A103;O1      ;"Apperian a mobile applications management MAM firm from Boston announced a 12 million round today led by Malaysia-based First Floor Capital

Bessemer Venture Partners Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers North Bridge Venture Partners Intel Capital and CommonAngels Ventures also participated Today’s investment brings the total raised to date to just over 39 million dollars

This is the first time Apperian has sought funding since a modest 4 million round back in January 2013

Mobile Applications Management is a term for provisioning software developed in-house You could call it a private app store

Apperian actually started out as an enterprise mobile applications developer back in 2009 To give you some context of the market back then  while  By 2009 there probably weren’t a ton of enterprise customers looking for custom mobile applications except for the most experimental of the bunch

Yet Apperian endured and developed into an enterprise app store company when customers began asking for an alternative to launching their custom apps in public app stores from Apple and Google

While Apperian tends to compete with Mobile Device Management MDM vendors like AirWatch which was sold to VMware and Good Technology  the company differentiates itself from these vendors by allowing customers to deploy outside of an MDM system CEO Brian Day explained

The company believes this gives them a leg up with customers that want to deploy custom apps to partners consultants and other non-employees who would likely be reluctant to let these companies have access to their phones

While leading with an Asian investment company might seem out of the ordinary Day said his company went this route for a couple of reasons First of all it wanted favorable terms and valuation that wouldn’t require board-level involvement While the company wouldn’t disclose its valuation Day did indicate it was an up round from its previous investment announcements

Secondly First Floor gives the Boston company an in-road into Asia where it has very little presence right now While its development office is in Spain and that has helped build a presence in the EU so far Apperian has had only small deals in Asia It’s is hoping that by connecting with an Asian firm this will help gain entrée into this market

Since the last funding round the market seems to have caught up with Apperian Today it’s seeing much larger deals with the average deal size having doubled since the last round some on the high end with as many as 100000 users Day said

Customers include Aetna AT&T&comma; Emory Healthcare Reed Elsevier Toyota and Walgreens

The company has 67 employees and it expects to add another 12-14 by the end of the year using this
