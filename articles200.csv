A1,"B rand investment in mobile advertising is growing quickly — spending is projected to reach $46 bn in 2019, according to Forrester — yet only 1% of those ads receive any type of engagement. 
 
What tools and resources do advertisers and agencies have to report and analyse the 99% of unclicked impressions? These ad impressions have value, but there are only flawed and debatable tools for measurement. 
 
Impressions shouldn’t be wasted 
 
Unclicked ads should not be universally discounted as wasted impressions. A recent mobile advertising neuroscience study from Sharethrough and Nielsen showed how impressions can influence brand perception. Analytics platforms, from Moat to IAS, have focused heavily on viewability by making certain that ads are viewable. Contrary to the IAB standard for viewability, which is “a minimum of 50% of pixels in view for a minimum of one second,” WPP agency GroupM and Unilever announced earlier this year that they would only count video impressions when 100% of the ad player is in view. 
 
Additional measurement techniques are needed to help the industry gauge the value of a viewable impression, especially on a mobile device where a full-screen, viewable impression means a captivated audience. 
 
Survey measurement is flawed 
 
Since the dawn of the commercial internet, the value of display ad impressions has largely been measured through surveys. These are usually online audiences, segmented by consumers who have and have not seen a marketing campaign or creative and asked to respond to a brand perception questionnaire. This approach only taps into a person’s conscious brain — a major shortcoming. 
 
Subconscious brain activity 
 
According to research from the Laboratory for Cognitive Psychophysiology at the University of Illinois, only 5% of the brain’s activity is expended on conscious activity. The remaining brain activity is devoted largely to unconscious processing. Developing a more comprehensive measurement system for mobile impressions will require tapping deeper into subconscious activity. Wearable devices that track neurological activity are readily available to consumers, from MindWave to MUSE and Melon. 
 
Use eye-tracking 
 
A number of software and hardware companies are developing advanced eye-tracking and emotion-sensing tools, such as Tobii and PredictGaze. Extending these technologies to work with the front-facing camera on smartphones only makes sense. I predict that Samsung’s Smart Scroll feature, which uses eye-tracking software to page up or down, will be deployed for advertising measurement in the not-too-distant future. To assuage understandable consumer privacy concerns, companies developing this technology would require an opt-in for this type of measurement. 
 
The “cancel event” 
 
Beyond opt-in neurological measurement and eye-tracking measures for signaling actions and interest, we must consider other engagements beyond the click. Analytics companies like Nudge are measuring mouseover time   on desktop platforms. The equivalent to hover time on mobile would be placing your finger down on the screen and pulling it off without actually tapping through. This action, known as a “cancel event” in iOS, is not being tracked by advertisers, but could still signal intent and ad interaction. 
 
Improving the ecosystem 
 
Brands will continue to demand new measurement standards and technologies to better understand the role that impressions play in their digital ad spend. Digital publishers will benefit, as they will be able to c ommand premiums when ads that are simply seen and not “clicked” have a clear and proven benefit to the advertiser. And ultimately the consumer will always benefit from more relevant, less interruptive and more engaging advertising creative designed to enhance their experience. – Brandrepublic.

A3,"Frank Water's writing day always began at seven each morning and lasted until around noon. ""Then I'd go out and chop wood, run errands and in the evening I'd do my research reading."" His trilogy research was confined to the mining industry and his books were peopled by his own family, his grandfather in particular. He was a lovable old character, ""and not quite the crackpot I made him out to be.""
His first six or seven manuscripts were written in ink on legal-size paper, then mailed to his sister to type. The routine had to change when he was asked to write a motion picture script for Hollywood in 1941, which necessitated the purchase of a typewriter. Waters learned to type with two to four fingers.
""I still use the little portable Olivetti,"" he said, ""and when that breaks down, I'm going to have to stop writing. I'm not mechanically-minded and I've never even owned an electric typewriter."" A word processor? ""I don't want one. They just confuse me.""
When asked whether characters or plots are more important, Waters said, ""I never make up a blueprint because I found out that when you plot a book, like an architect who takes a plan of a house  he's going to build, and just adheres to it--if you plot a book and then sit down to write, there's nothing more to do. You've already done it. A story has an organic growth of its own, and you just have to let it flow at its own pace. I know about what I want, about where I'm going, but how to get there I don't know. So I just sit down and let it come.
""I never sat down consciously to write a novel. It is so frightening. I'm just too scared to do that. You think of so many things. You've got to have a plot. Then you've got to have characters and you think of all the ones you've got to develop. Who's to be important and how will I do that, and then the  writing and the mood and the place. And all this is in your mind and it's just a frightening thing. So you sit down and say, 'Well, I can't pull all this stuff together, but I'll just write a few pages to see how it might go. And then you write a few more pages.'""
Waters leaned back, his fingers drumming the table as he continued: ""But the thing to guard against is when you sit down to do that first page over and over again so it will be perfect. And you think of all these things you want to articulate, so that it will be a good beginning. But you never get to the second page 'cause you want that first page so perfect. So you can't be afraid. You just have to jot down anything as it comes without worrying how it will sound until you get it all down--without worrying about punctuation. And then when you revise it, you use the other part of your brain, the analytical part. Then you can throw out a page or rewrite it.""
The author never had a strict working schedule. He wrote until ""the well is empty. I don't try to force it. I just leave it until the next day when the well will be filled up again.""
His books required an average of two years to write and  he was never completely satisfied with them. He wasn't one to plunge in immediately into another book the moment the previous one was in the mail to his publisher. ""I work so hard and long on a book, I'll just not do anything for a while. But I find out in a very short time that I feel lost without working on something, so various ideas start to pop up.""
Some writers enjoy writing. Waters found it ""a chore, a real job, but you do get a little satisfaction and you feel good that you are in the creative process. It's confining and you're never free of it. It bugs you all the time. But I always try to forget it. That's the best thing to do. But I'll think I should have worked an hour later and carried on with ""How will I do it?"" I try to forget it, reminding myself that the well is dry.""
Waters stopped jotting down notes of inspiration after he'd had a few drinks because ""everything looks so rosy and you rush to the desk to write down those beautiful lines and then you get up in the morning cold sober and see that it's rotten and has to be thrown away.
His first Hollywood scripting job was to write the screenplay from his novel River Lady for a producer named Selznick in 1941, which was then scrapped when Pearl Harbor was bombed that year. The motion picture was to star Clark Gable, but was later produced starring Dan Duryea and without Waters. In 1956 he was commissioned by C.V. Pitney pictures to write the development of the American Space Flight Program, which evolved into the history of transportation.
""I went back to the first transport vehicle in American history--those big wagon trains though the Cumberland Mountains, then into covered wagons across the great plains, and the Studebaker wagons and Studebaker cars, and so on.""
Waters and  his fourth wife Barbara traveled to Mexico, Central and South America for research. ""I like the people,"" he said, ""the Indians and the Spanish. It's an old land with the feeling of richness that we don't have here."" The Waters lived in Taos, New Medico, during the warm months and in Tucson during the winter. The author lived in the mountains above Taos for more than forty years and made friends among the Pueblo Indians and descendants of Spanish conquistadors. His friend White Bear was instrumental in having the author adopted in his tribe's Coyote Clan, an unusual occurrence because Native Americans guard their ancient secrets from outsiders. The ceremonials of the kiva and other traditional customs are neglected because of social and economic pressures as well. ""The kids want what white kids have and they leave the reservations to get jobs. They don't want to stay and grow corn in the old ways.""
 Mystery reading was his favorite pastime, but he only published one of his own, based on an old murder case involving some of his Taos neighbors. ""You've got to have a good tight plot and I just couldn't concoct a detective story to save myself--planting clues and all that. I've got two or three favorite authors and one of my favorite series is about a detective named Napoleon Bonaparte, a half-breed--half white, half aboriginal--in Australia's outback. They're all fabulous stories, written some fifty years ago with some of the old aboriginal religious customs and mental telepathy, the same as the Indians in this country. They're just now beginning to be published in England and the U.S. If you can find them, they're worth reading.""

A4,"TORONTO , Sept. 24, 2015 /CNW/ - On Thursday, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), and Deloitte launched Game Plan – a high performance athlete wellness and transition program designed to give Canadian athletes new tools to pursue excellence during and beyond their sporting careers. 

The COC and Deloitte also announced the renewal of their partnership through 2032 – an unprecedented term of engagement, highlighting Deloitte's positive impact on the sport system in Canada . The COC also announced today that human resources leader, Morneau Shepell , is partnering with the organization through 2020 as an official supporter and founding partner of the Game Plan program, providing a suite of mental health services to athletes. 
   
The Game Plan program, which is supported by the Canadian Paralympic Committee (CPC), Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Sport Institute Network (COPSI Network), has a goal to provide Canadian athletes with resources for life beyond sport. This new initiative which has been near three years in development, takes a proactive approach to total athlete wellness. It is designed to alleviate life's common stressors and distractors, allowing athletes and coaches to focus on performing when it matters most. 

The Game Plan program takes the very best information from all of its partners to cultivate an elite ecosystem of resources all in one place. Game Plan advisors will form part of the integrated support teams for athletes, working alongside sport scientists and performance experts. Game Plan Advisors are skilled in supporting athletes, drawing on their knowledge of high performance sport, career development, transition planning and goal-setting. 

Both Olympic and Paralympic athletes and hopefuls will be encouraged to access the five distinct elements of the Game Plan program, which include: education, skill development, health, network, and career management . Each element is then made up of various pertinent modules – 33 initially, with others being added as the program evolves. Some examples of specific modules and resources that will be available to athletes include: 
Career Management – a job board featuring flexible work opportunities for athletes Network – a mentoring program set up between transitioning athletes and next generation hopefuls Education – specialized training opportunities and flexible class schedules at participating institutions Skill Development – conferences and webinars educating athletes on personal and corporate brand management, public speaking skills and financial planning Health – access to mental health support 24/7 and mental health awareness training. 
Ease of use and accessibility for athletes will be key to the program, with all resources being consolidated in a new website at www.mygameplan.ca . Specific resources will be delivered in multiple platforms at convenient times including through conferences, digital applications, one-on-one counselling, and group sessions. 

Game Plan is now available for athletes, with modules for each element becoming more comprehensive as the program grows and develops.

Todd McCarthy couldn't think of a better way to win the Sydney drivers' premiership than share it with his older brother Luke. At least that is what he says. The 22-year-old came from a win behind at the final meeting of the season at Menangle to draw level but couldn't go past one of the blokes who taught him to drive.

""I had some of the best blokes to teach [me] how to drive in dad, Luke and Andy,"" McCarthy said. ""To share it with Luke was special and in a way made it better. But we are both very competitive and I wanted to beat him but it just didn't happen.""

McCarthy, who drove 31 city winners for the season, is the new type of driver that brings an American style to Menangle.

""I have watched a lot of American racing on the computer and with the big tracks over there it is something I have tried to do in my driving, leaning back like they do over there,"" McCarthy said. ""This has easily been my biggest season and it is great to win the premiership.""

McCarthy had chances to better his brother Luke after winning on Shannonsablast, he was runner-up in the feature of the night on Golden Montana, ran third in a three-way photo behind Monifieth but the final race looked his real opportunity.

He got to the front on $1.40 favourite Merrywood Ruby but was run down by Boundtobemad.

""She is a nice filly but the other one was probably a little underrated,"" McCarthy said.

Commodity markets were rallying as investors continued to digest data out Friday that showed a drop in active drilling rigs in the U.S. The decline could signal a slowdown in U.S. production that would address a supply-demand imbalance in commodity markets. 
 
U.S. oil producers idled eight more rigs over the past week, bringing the total to 644 according to Baker Hughes data. That marks a third straight week. The oil rig count is now down 60% from a peak set last October. West Texas Intermediate closed up 4.5% to $46.68 a barrel.

Stocks have been under pressure after the Fed made it clear last week that a rate hike this year was still likely. The Fed's dot plot forecast showed that Fed members expect interest rates to close out the year at 0.40%, meaning a hike in October or December is a possibility. A majority of Fed members expect to raise rates this year, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference.""

Related: Tom Watson urges Corbyn to hold Labour debate on Trident and Nato Instead, Corbyn attended the Camden and Islington NHS Mental Health Trust fun day in central London, giving a speech to a small crowd in what he described as a his “first official engagement” since becoming party leader. — Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) September 13, 2015 Attended & spoke at Camden & Islington NHS Mental Health Trust's Fun Day -important annual community engagement event pic.twitter.com/sZO81K6yGT In many ways, it is as one would expect of a man who has had anything but a good press throughout his parliamentary career. He doesn’t much care for newspapers.
Why should he? Like all leftwingers, especially those prepared to stand up for unpopular causes, Corbyn has suffered from a mixture of marginalisation and demonisation. Being marginalised – meaning ignored – has also meant that his TV appearances have been few and far between. Again, that has hardly endeared him to mainstream broadcasters. So his single statement about the media during his leadership campaign, made to the Financial Times, amounted to just three sentences: I think there is far too much concentration in the hands of too few and so I would look at that again. Diversity in media is something that is intrinsic to a democratic society. We do not want the whole media owned by one person. This was interpreted, possibly correctly, as an intention to tackle Rupert Murdoch’s concentration of media ownership. But, of course, Corbyn will need to win the next general election to turn an intention into action. On his website there is a piece, written just before the London mayoral election in 2008, in which Corbyn argued that “the role of the print media needs to be seriously challenged”. He was particularly concerned about what he detected as pro-Boris Johnson and anti-Ken Livingstone coverage of the contest in the London Evening Standard. Corbyn wrote: “While there’s nothing wrong with the forensic examination of any candidate’s policies or record, there is something deeply disturbing about the way in which the media have obsessed themselves with Livingstone, while the shallow banality of Johnson’s rather flimsy policy pronouncements remain unchallenged.” It might be expected of a man of the left that he sees some virtues at the very least in Britain’s public service broadcaster. But he will not have been overly impressed with last Monday’s BBC Panorama, which his supporters regarded as something of a hatchet job. Several described it as an establishment smear and Corbyn’s team argued that it was factually inaccurate and complained to the BBC to demand an apology. It is unclear whether that programme was the reason for Corbyn pulling out of a planned appearance on Sunday’s Andrew Marr Show. Nor will Corbynites have been amused by the piece to camera in the BBC news bulletins on Saturday by its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. She suggested Labour had not learned lessons from its past.
What are we therefore to make of Corbyn’s future relationship with the media? Most newspapers will continue to deride him and will continue digging deep into the archives to discover material about him they regard as embarrassing. One paper he can look to for support is the Morning Star, the daily that takes its editorial line from the Communist Party of Britain. The paper, believed to have a circulation between 10,000 to 20,000, published a rare Sunday edition celebrating his election win – “Jeremy Storms to Victory” – and editor Ben Chacko joined Marr on BBC1 for his paper review. — Nick Sutton (@suttonnick) September 12, 2015 Victory Sunday Special edition of Morning Star: Jeremy storms to victory #tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers pic.twitter.com/fckASQzVLA Perhaps the Daily Mirror, having supported Andy Burnham, will build bridges. The Guardian and the Independent are likely to offer impartial coverage. But Corbyn will not be cosying up to the Sun, à la Tony Blair. He will not make the mistake of posing with a copy of the paper, as Ed Miliband did. And he will not cooperate with the Daily Mail. Rightwing papers will treat him as they did Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock. And he probably accepts that there is nothing to be done on that front. But will he dare to advance a media policy based around ownership redistribution? Will it include a demand that Murdoch’s UK company divests itself of certain titles? Despite his new deputy, Watson, not sharing his politics, he will find that they hold very similar views about the press. In a speech in December last year, Watson – a supporter of the Hacked Off campaign – accused the press of operating “like a mafia, intimidating here, bribing there, terminating careers when it suits them and rewarding their most loyal toadies.” He also scorned the regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, set up by publishers. Corbyn and Watson are going to have a torrid time. That may enhance their standing within the Labour movement, but the relentless drip-drip-drip of negativity in the mainstream press will surely have an effect on the uncommitted centre ground. At least, in Scotland, Corbyn has one strong press supporter, the Daily Record. Conceivably, that could win back Labour votes from the SNP."

A9,"State Rep. Holly Raschein. Photo courtesy Florida Fish and Wildlife .  
Republicans have a problem: They are often presumed to be bigots. 
 
Part of the problem is one of their own making. While many of the candidates in the GOP presidential field have staked slightly more nuanced positions, all of them have still said they believe marriage should be restricted to one man and one woman. Socially liberal Republicans ( who do, in fact, exist ) have often been drowned out in the past by those who refuse to acknowledge or accept this century’s broader view of what equal protection under the law means in daily life. 
 
But another part of the problem is that in many corners of the media and in the public mind, the very term Republican almost means “intolerant,” to the point that it is considered newsworthy when a member of the GOP behaves contrary to the stereotype. 
 
Hats off to Florida state Rep. Holly Raschein for doing something to change that, by promoting legislation to provide legal protections to gay and transgender Floridians. 
 
Florida is one of 28 states that do not currently offer workers legal protection against employment discrimination based on their sexual orientation, and is among the 31 that do not offer such protection based on gender identity. (A few of these states do extend protection to job candidates or employees for state employment only.) Local ordinances cover 10 counties and 22 municipalities in Florida, representing about half of the state’s population, but 57 of the state’s counties still offer no such protection. 
 
Raschein, a Republican who represents Monroe County in the state legislature, is co-sponsoring a bill for the 2016 legislative session to extend protections throughout the state. The proposal, called the Florida Competitive Workforce Act , would add sexual orientation and gender identity or expression to the list of protected classes covered under Florida’s employment discrimination law. 
 
Speaking to the Miami Herald, Raschein emphasized that there was no conflict between her political identity and her choice to champion this legislation. “I can be just as conservative as I want to be and still believe in eliminating discrimination of LGBT people,” she said. She added that her identities as a conservative, a Baptist and a mother had absolutely no bearing on “doing the right thing.” 
 
I am a Republican, and I wouldn’t mind having my business endorse the proposed Florida legislation, if anyone happened to ask us. At this point it’s hard to imagine why anyone would reject a job candidate because that individual is, or seems to be, gay, bisexual or transgender, unless those traits had some relationship to the actual job. (The Florida bill, like most similar statutes in other states, includes an exception for bona fide occupational requirements. We still won’t get any Jewish priests in Catholic churches and, for the foreseeable future, no openly gay ones either.) 
 
That scenario is hard to picture, but still not impossible. It wasn’t so long ago that we were fighting over whether gay servicemen and women could openly serve in the U.S. armed forces without jeopardizing the security of the nation. And it has taken us until now to even begin the process of lifting the ban on transgender personnel . The type of thinking that created and supported such bans may be less common and less open these days, but it has not gone away entirely. Even though same-sex marriage is now the law of the land, 39 percent of Americans still say they oppose it. 
 
But given the strong correlation between support for LGBT rights and age, it seems inevitable that, sooner than later, the opponents of LGBT civil rights will be as reluctant to openly admit their position  as the rare opponent of interracial marriage or women in the military today. 
 
Why should someone have to conceal his or her sexual orientation or gender to get a job as an accountant or to rent an apartment? There is no logical reason, and our laws should reflect as much. 
 
Conservative or liberal, Republican or Democrat, we answered these questions with respect to race and religion a long time ago. We are finally getting around to it with respect to a person’s private sexuality and public identity. If the holdouts who think civil rights protections are a bad thing want to flock to Republican primaries, we can’t stop them, but we certainly should not give them more than their due. Candidates shouldn’t either.

It is still a problem for Republicans that the Miami Herald considers it particularly relevant that the sponsor of the Florida bill is a conservative, Republican, straight, Baptist mom.

A11,"WASHINGTON:  US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter offered assurances Friday that the Iran nuclear deal will leave Washington with a “more effective” military option if that becomes necessary. 
 
Carter defended the agreement in an opinion piece in USA Today, arguing it would lead to a more durable outcome. 
 
But the Pentagon chief said the military option was still on the table and, if called for, such action would be “more effective” as a result of the agreement. 
 
World powers and Iran struck the landmark deal in July after years of negotiations to address Western concerns that Tehran was developing a nuclear bomb.

“Its implementation will block the pathways Iran could take to build a nuclear bomb. That long-term outcome is more durable than one a military strike would bring about,” Carter wrote. 
 
“While I am responsible for that alternative and know that it would be effective at setting back Iran’s nuclear programme, it would do so with potentially serious second- and third-order repercussions, and the likely need to repeat attacks once Iran sought to rebuild its capability.” 
 
But Carter argued the deal also made the option of military action by the US against Iran stronger going forward.

“The military option is real today and, as secretary of defense, I will be sure that remains true well into the future,” he wrote. 
 
“Indeed, the reality is that any prospective military option, if called for, will be more effective under this deal — not less. Iran will have a smaller and more concentrated civil nuclear programme, and the deal’s verification provisions will give us more information with which to plan.” 
 
US President Barack Obama earned enough backing in Congress this week to make sure the deal is not blocked by lawmakers. The agreement will ease Western sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran curtailing its nuclear programme.

Many Republicans, however, believe the Islamic republic will still seek to cheat its way to developing an atomic bomb. 
 
A public relations battle was launched over the agreement, which is to be put to a vote in Congress next week. 
 
Tehran has steadfastly denied the claims it is developing a nuclear bomb and argued that its nuclear capabilities were for civilian use.

A12,"David Beckham dressed up in fancy dress as Freddie Mercury as he gushed about missing his family 
David Beckham as Freddie Mercury 
There are two kind of people in this world. Those who get really into fancy dress, and those who sweat with fear over those two dreaded words. 
 
And David Beckham is certainly in the first camp, as he shared a photo of him looking like Freddie Mercury , along with two of his buddies.

 READ MORE CELEBRITY NEWS 
 
Thankfully, all our favourite celebs seem to follow in Becks’ footsteps and love putting on a costume and even slapping some make-up or donning the occasional web, just as much as we do! 
 
So here are some of the best celebrity fancy dress costumes we’ve ever laid eyes on… 
 
1.) David Beckham as Freddie Mercury 
 We’re giving Becks 10 out of 10 for his effort of the Queen lead singer. We had to take a double take over the moustache and epic raised eyebrow! Oh, and he was uber sweet as he captioned the pic gushing about how much he was missing his family: ‘Can’t wait to get home to see my beautiful wife and unbelievable children.’ N’awww. 
 
2.) Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton as Ab Fab 
 For a special edition of Celebrity Juice our favourite female duo telly dressed up as our other favourite female duo of all-time. It was so spot-one it was almost like looking into the future – we can 100% see best friends Fearne and Holly growing old together and transforming into Absolutely Fabulous ’ Patsy and Eddy. 
 3.) Kate Moss as Cara Delevingne 
 They’ve done campaigns together, sat on the front row of Fashion Week together, and even shoot photos of each other in a sexy photoshoot, so there’s no mistaking that these two supermodels love one another. But it like model-ception as Kate Moss donned a slogan t-shirt and stuck out that iconic Cara Delevingne tongue – you know what they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! 
 
4.) Nick Grimshaw as Lily Allen 
 It’s not often we see ol’ Grimmy out of his standard skinny black jeans and wacky fun shirt combo. But when he switched his style up a bit, we didn’t expect to see him looking like THIS. Paying homage to his mate Lily Allen – Rememnber? When she used to wear poufy ballgowns with high top trainers? – we can’t stop laughing at this fancy dress option. Oh Nick, you do always manage to make us LOL. 
 
5.) Rochelle Humes as Princess Jasmine 
 
In case you’re wondering if Disney Princesses actually do exist (they definitely do btw), then look no further than The Saturdays ’ Rochelle Humes , who looked liked the perfect princess when she dressed up as Jasmine from Aladdin . She was even joined by her animated mates Prince Charming in the form of One Direction ‘s Niall Horan , and of course her very own prince, Aladdin as dressed up by hubby Marvin Humes . 
 6.) Charlotte Crosby as Cheryl 
 Why ay man! From one Geordie lass to another, when Charlotte Crosby put on THAT soldier outfit from Cheryl ’s Fight For This Love video, we couldn’t help but feel all partiotric and stuff at the Newcastle solidarity shown. Oh, and the fact that she looked just as bangin’ as our Chezza did – looking good girls! 
 
 
Right, we’re getting our next fancy dress thinking caps on ready for the next party! 
 
Think Nick Grimshaw looks different as Lily Allen? SEE how much he’s changed over the years…

A13,"Max Wolter and Terry Peterson with a 23-inch Hayward area walleye (Photo: Courtesy of ) 

And here comes fall...  This week has been a treat.  I took a couple of days off and spent some time on the water with my good buddy Terry Peterson, and we started out on Tuesday by returning a favor.  Wisconsin DNR Fisheries Biologist Max Wolter was kind enough to take Terry and I out this past spring to help check nets as they did their annual population surveys on the Hayward, WI area lakes.  It was about time he got to see the fruits of his labor!  We spent the morning focusing on walleyes and found some fish up to 23"" in 30' - 35' of water on jigs and minnows.  It wasn't a fast bite by any means, but we were able to locate some willing fish.  In the afternoon we turned our attention to smallmouth and found plenty of nice fish up to 18"" on rocks in 14' - 18' of water using minnows and drop shotting plastics.  Water temperatures held around 72 degrees on a warm day with bright skies.  With Terry (The Professor) and a local fisheries biologist in the boat those fish had no idea what hit them...  They didn't stand a chance!!!  Thanks for all of your hard work on our lakes Max.  You're doing a fantastic job, and your efforts are appreciated by all of us who use and depend on these lakes. 

Terry and I were back in the boat on Thursday with Terry's long time customer and friend Orville Landry from Hinsdale, IL.  Orville has been fishing with Terry for over 20 years and it was a really neat opportunity to fish with another guide and one of his long time customers.  We chased crappies all day and found them scattered in small schools over 21' - 25' of water.  They weren't bunched up like they've been in previous days, and I suspect the cold front with north winds we had coming in had something to do with it.  We'd catch a few fish up to 12"" out of every school on plastics but had to move frequently to stay on biters.  I also noticed that some fish were relating to the thermocline, and others were relating to deep basins.  It was a good example on how to stay on top of fish at this time of year, and I couldn't have had two more capable guys in my boat.  Water temps held around 70 degrees on a cool day with high skies and north winds.  Thanks for the great day and all of the great laughs guys.  I had a blast! 

I was back to work on Friday and Fall arrived with stiff north winds and air temps in the 50's.  Hard to believe we were steaming hot just 5 days ago...  Good friend and customer Jon Schlussler from St. Paul, MN returned and brought buddy Greg Kennedy from Sillwater, MN to chase smallies on Chequamegon Bay.  We started out hot boating a couple of nice fish including Jon's fat 21"" bruiser, but things got funky in a hurry.  North winds picked up to over 20 mph, and we had a hard time staying on fish.  Time to move...  We went inland for the afternoon, and it proved to be a good decision.  We were immediately on a hot bite landing lots of good fish up to 20"" on minnows in 13' - 18' of water.  It was pure chaos at times with both guys battling fish after fish.  We even connected on a couple of double opportunities that included a late day rally with a bonus walleye.  Water temps inland were around 69 degrees, but I expect that to plummet over the next few days with cold nights in the forecast.  It's always a blast to have Jon in the boat, and Greg was a welcome addition.  Good thing I pointed out schlussler8those feeding fish at the end of the day to you Jon...  What would you do with out me?  See you in a couple of weeks my friend!!! 

Fourteen years ago the world stopped turning on this day.  In some ways it feels like yesterday and in others it was a lifetime ago.  One thing is for sure, it's not forgotten!!!  To all of our firemen, police officers, and first responders...  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!  To all of the families of the victims...  You're always in our thoughts.  God Bless America!!!

In my observation, there is more than one discipline that can lead to investment success, and some of the proven ones are quite different from each other. The secret to investing successfully, therefore, is to adopt and follow a discipline that is in harmony with your personality. For my part, I feel in total harmony with the contrarian and value disciplines that have guided my investments for 40 years. At the same time, I also claim (and aim) to be a long-term investor. Yet, almost from the start of my career, I have had the somewhat uncomfortable feeling that, in practice, these claims may be contradictory. The value discipline implies more trading than one would wish The basic tenet of value investing is that you should buy a stock well below a conservative calculation of its intrinsic value. This, however, implies a corollary: When a stock gets well above that purchase price, and thus no longer represents value, it should be sold. With the well-known bipolar characteristics of the stock market, this means that value investing is bound to cause more trading than a conservative, long-term investor would, in theory, prefer. Ben Graham, godfather of value investing, advised buying stocks of companies at a conservatively adjusted value of liquid or nearly liquid assets, reduced by all liabilities. On the sell side, his advice was fairly simple: Sell once you're up 50 percent, or sell in two years, whichever happens first. This tells us that Graham, whom many still revere as the epitome of a long-term investor, did not in fact have a time horizon much in excess of two years. Warren Buffett, Graham’s self-proclaimed disciple, in practice has adopted a somewhat different approach during his career, as illustrated by statements in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) chairman’s letters: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” (1989) weakens Graham’s narrow criteria for purchase; and “When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever” (1988) seems to do away with the sell side of the value discipline. This evolution reflects the fact that, after being schooled by Graham, Buffett became importantly influenced by Phil Fisher, who could have been labeled the godfather of growth investing. In particular, while the early Buffett claimed to find all the information he needed in companies’ annual reports, Fisher advocated research based on deep and frequent contacts at all levels of a company – he was looking for excellence in the management of businesses he selected. In 1987 investment adviser John Train described Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) as 85% influenced by Benjamin Graham and 15% by Philip Fisher (""The Midas Touch,"" Harriman House, 2009). Today it is quite possible that these proportions have been reversed, which allows Buffett to keep a significant portion of his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio with little or no trading. However, it seems that the performance of that portfolio has become more average in recent years. This may be due to the fact investments in small and medium-sized companies, which are followed by fewer analysts and where value is thus somewhat easier to uncover, are less meaningful in a portfolio of the size now held by Berkshire Hathaway. Contrarian investing and the acceleration of everything Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio), founder of The Baupost Group, summarizes: “Value investing is at its core the marriage of a contrarian streak and a calculator” (Outstanding Investor Digest, March 17, 2009). This gives me a convenient transition to a review of contrarian investing: I saw an earlier version of the cartoon on the left several years ago, and it stuck in my mind as a perfect illustration of the insanity of blindly extrapolating the recent past, as many stock market investors tend to do. The more recent cartoon on the right, quoting comedian Steven Wright, is a wonderful warning of the dangers of complacency. Put another way, to a contrarian, the tendency just to follow recent market momentum because the consensus complacently dictates doing so is no better than assuming there is no danger in walking toward a cliff just because you haven’t fallen off yet. In 1949 Life magazine hailed Humphrey B. Neill as the father of contrary opinion. In ""The Art of Contrary Thinking"" (Caxton Press, 1954), Neill wrote, “No problem connected with the Theory of Contrary Opinion is more difficult to solve than … how to know what prevailing general opinions are and how to measure their prevalence and intensity.” Today’s constant flow of news reports that are both instantaneous and repetitive, as well as the multiplication of commentaries and opinions on both old and new media, makes it even harder than in 1954 to evaluate the importance and significance of a consensus. Our natural tendency to think that we belong to the original-thinking minority leads us to exaggerate the size and strength of views contrary to our own. One fact remains true, however: The more media coverage predictions we receive, the more inaccurate they are likely to be. Neill said it some 60 years ago: I think I am on safe ground in asserting that so long as predictions remain popular and are so numerous as they are today – and so long as they receive notoriety through repetition in the press and on the radio – contrary opinions will increase in importance as thinking aids. Several knowledgeable and successful investors helped refine the notion further. For example, Barry Ritholtz reminds us that the contrarian should be looking at what will frustrate the largest number of people; Michael Steinhardt warns that contrarian investing isn't just about going against the grain – it's about exploiting expectations; and Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio) tells us to look for cases where uniform belief has led to a mispricing of expectations and thus a way to make money. The problem in recent years has been the exponential growth and acceleration in the dissemination of news, opinions and forecasts. It helps to remember that when you see an expert opinion quoted in the newspapers or expressed on television, it reflects less a recent conclusion reached by an expert than the journalist’s choice to quote or invite that expert. Not only do journalists constitute a crowd; because of their race for novelty and sensationalism, theirs is a particularly volatile crowd. In a way, the Internet – where the available information is often selected, not by a person, but by an algorithm based on the popularity of posts – is an even better measure of the crowd; but unfortunately it is just as volatile in its offerings. As a result, except for rare consensus extremes, the contrarian approach is even less useful than in the past to time investments precisely. Saved by the clock! In a March 25 article, The Motley Fool offered the following quote from Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio): ""Time is the individual investor's last remaining edge on professionals. If you can think about the next five years while most are focused on the next five months, you have an advantage over everyone who tries to outperform based on sheer intellect."" In doing my research for this paper, I came across an article by Andrew Szabo, managing director of Greenwich Financial Management Inc. (Jan. 31, 2005). I do not know Szabo, but I believe his conclusion makes a lot of sense: The horizon over which you intend to invest is very important. There is a tremendous amount of money around that is seeking short-term returns. First, there are the “day traders,” which includes almost every market maker on Wall Street and many amateur investors. Next, there are the hedge funds, which tend to be very influenced by monthly reporting. Mutual fund managers tend to think in terms of quarters and full years, which is how pension fund consultants rate them. I believe the most attractive underused horizon is three to five years. Opinions and consensuses about the financial markets and the economies will continue to fluctuate along cycles that will often be too short to make a systematic contrarian approach compatible with a long-term investment strategy. But opportunities remain for a contrarian/value approach if one carefully selects one’s time horizon. We receive an enormous number of research reports on individual companies from brokers and other organizations. What is striking is how few analysts look beyond one or two years into the future. These are intelligent and educated individuals, so the chances of the consensus of analysts being drastically wrong in its anticipation of sales and earnings over such short horizons are relatively slim. This is especially so as, contrary to historical practices, company managements now “whisper” guidance about forthcoming results to the investment community. (Incidentally, and ironically, whenever a company’s actual results fail to reach the whispered numbers, analysts now report that it has “missed” the estimates. Of course, if the analysts had done their jobs, their estimates might have been different from the company’s whispers – and in fact, in such cases, it is the analysts’ estimates that “missed” the actual results.) My experience of recent years is that, if we are defining opportunities in terms of stocks about which expectations have fallen well below what common sense and our calculator tell us the underlying companies are worth, the three-to-five-year horizon should prove a fertile ground. Most analysts do not venture that far ahead, most institutional investors with supervisory guidelines and an eye on short-term relative performance are not interested, and the media’s time horizon keeps getting shorter rather than longer. At this writing, a majority of investors is still in shock from the tremors of the last few days, when major stock markets suffered their first significant corrections in six years. After such a long period of levitation and complacency, it could be argued that many stocks resembled flies in search of a windshield. As usual, once the flies found the windshield, experts and others frantically got busy pointing the finger to possible culprits: Greece, China, oil, governments and central banks, etc. Yet, I am convinced that there was no need for a particular trigger: Experience could have told us that such a correction was inevitable and that only the timing was uncertain. It is entirely possible that the current correction might continue and even worsen for a while, so there is no reason to indulge in a routine that became fashionable in recent years: “buying the dips.” On the other hand, we should not lose sight of the fact that stock-market performances have not been uniform in 2009-2015. With the general market indices down only modestly from their highs (though with a fanfare in the last few days), there is a broad sample of stocks that are already 30 to 50 percent below their five-year highs – a performance more in line with historical bear markets. A stock price doesn’t tell you anything about a company’s worth, but it tells you a lot about the popularity of the company with the crowd of investors. Simple contrarian opinion tells us that these stocks are not in favor and that, on a three-to-five-year horizon, this is where we should be looking for opportunities – with our calculator in hand.

A16,"Members of the Aylesbury child abuse ring have been handed lengthy jail sentences for grooming vulnerable under-age white girls for sex for as little as ""the price of a McDonald's, a milkshake and cinema ticket"". 

The Asian men were convicted at the Old Bailey of a range of sex offences between 2006 and 2012 including multiple rape of a child under 13, child prostitution and administering a substance to ""stupefy"" a girl in order to engage in sexual activity.

Today, Vikram Singh, Asif Hussain, Arshad Jani, Mohammed Imran, Akbari Khan and Taimoor Khan were jailed for between three years and 19-and-a-half years.

Most of the offences related to child A, who was present in court to see the men who robbed her of her teenage years sent down.

In a statement, she told of her feelings of ""worthlessness"" as she battled depression and alcohol addiction, adding: ""I feel my teenage years were taken away from me.""

Sentencing, judge John Bevan QC paid tribute to her bravery in laying b are her life ""warts and all"" and said the way some of the defendants took advantage of her vulnerability was ""grotesque"". 

He said: ""She sought friendship amongst Asian males in their 20s and for the price of a McDonald's, a milkshake and cinema ticket, she became 'liked' by stall holders in Aylesbury market, taxi and bus drivers.

""By the age of 13 she was sexually experienced, confusing sexual gratification for friendship and love.""

By the time she was 16, the girl had slept with just under 70 men and her vulnerability should have been ""blindingly obvious"", the judge said.

He went on: ""Why these defendants focused their attention on white under-age girls is unexplained but I have no doubt vulnerability played a substantial part in it.

""The combination of inadequate parenting leading to rebellious children lacking supervision provided an opportunity. 

""If they pursued Asian under-age girls, they would have paid a heavy price in their community."" 

The two victims came from troubled backgrounds and wanted to feel grown-up when they were befriended by the men, who groomed them by showering them with inexpensive gifts such as alcohol, DVDs, food and occasionally drugs. 

While aged just 12 or 13, child A was passed between some 60 mainly Asian men for sex after being conditioned into thinking it was normal behaviour, jurors were told.

The vast majority of the charges related to this child, while three charges related to girl B.

During the trial, prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC told the jury the youngsters were ""easy prey for a group of men wanting casual sexual gratification that was easy, regular and readily available"".

He said the girls' ideas of what was right had been ""completely distorted"", and that they thought what was happening was ""normal"" and ""natural"".

Many of the defendants were friends from the Aylesbury area. Some were married and had children, with some working on the market and a few working as taxi drivers. 

Singh, 45, of Cannock Road, Aylesbury, who has a wife and children, was told by Judge Bevan he bore a ""heavy responsibility"" for the ""degradation"" of Child A. He was jailed for a total of 17 and a half years for four counts of rape and administering a substance with intent. 

Hussain, 33, of Hodge Lea, Milton Keynes, who was convicted of three counts of rape was sentenced to 13 and a half years.

Jani, 33, of Cousins Drive, Aylesbury, received 13 years for rape and conspiracy to rape. The court heard the bus driver had supported a wife and 17-month-old daughter in Pakistan.

Imran, 38, of Springcliffe Street, Bradford, was convicted of three counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to rape and one count of child prostitution. The Pakistani national was jailed for 19-and-a-half years and faces the prospect of deportation afterwards.

He was the only defendant to express remorse for his actions today, saying through his lawyer he felt ""guilt and shame"" for what he had done.

Akbari Khan, 36, of Mandeville Road, Aylesbury, who was found guilty of two counts of rape, administering a substance with intent, and conspiracy to rape, was jailed for 16 years. He too has a wife and young daughter.

Taimoor Khan, 29, of Highbridge Road, Aylesbury, was sentenced to three years in prison for one count of sexual activity with a child.

The Canadian’s latest hit What Do You Mean? is back at Number One on today’s Official Chart Update after being dethroned by Sigala’s Easy Love last week. 
 [embedded content] 
However, the race for supremacy is very close, with Justin leading by just over 300 combined sales at the halfway stage. 
 
Justin returned to the top with What Do You Mean? a fortnight ago, capping a triumphant comeback. His smash-hit set a new record for the highest first-week streams for a single at 3.2 million plays. It also became his fastest selling single in the UK with a combined opening week sales total of 84,000 copies shifted.

There’s also a battle of the bands on this week’s Official Albums Chart, as Bring Me The Horizon’s That’s The Spirit takes on Stereophonics’ Keep The Village Alive for top spot. 
 
The fifth studio album from Bring Me The Horizon is currently out in front, but with just 1,000 copies separating them from Stereophonics at the halfway stage, it’s all to play for.

Following their reunion earlier this year, The Libertines are heading into the Top 40 with Anthems For Doomed Youth, their first studio album in 11 years.

A18,"WASHINGTON -- With a presidential debate and a contentious appearance in Congress coming, Hillary Rodham Clinton faces an October full of opportunity and risk for her presidential campaign. 
 
The former secretary of state has spent months watching her poll numbers sink in crucial early voting states and faced endless questions about her email practices at the State Department. 
 
The first Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas and her congressional testimony before a Republican-led panel investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, will give Clinton a big platform to make the case for her candidacy and challenge her Republican critics. 
 
These events, of course, are equally a platform for opponents to try to weaken her. 
 
Also in October, Clinton's campaign will disclose details about its fundraising and expenditures. The full Democratic field will appear at the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, which was a turning point for Barack Obama in his upstart bid against Clinton in the fall of 2007. 
 
The most pivotal development could come from Vice President Joe Biden. His potential entry into the Democratic field could shake up the race and offer the party another alternative to Clinton, along with her chief rival now, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
 
A preview of Clinton's October: 
 
__ 
 
BIDEN 
 
Will he or won't he? 
 
Biden's decision could have major ramifications for Clinton's standing in the primaries. If the vice president runs, he would give wary Democrats an excuse to abandon Clinton, even though she has locked up lots of congressional endorsements and financial donors. If Biden stays out, Clinton would campaign from a stronger position and could further make the case that she is the most electable Democrat against Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and others. Biden has said he is unsure whether he and his family will have the ""emotional energy"" for a campaign so soon after the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau Biden. But his appearances around the country have turned into a parlor game for political insiders, creating a distraction for Clinton as she tries to consolidate support. 
 
__ 
 
FUNDRAISING 
 
Clinton raised $47.5 million after launching her campaign in April. Her next fundraising report will show how she fared during the typical summer lull and give insiders a look into how efficiently her campaign is running. Clinton's team has built a massive operation at its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters and has hired dozens of field organizers in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where it has been spending about $400,000 a week on television advertising. Sanders is running a much leaner operation, and most of his $15.2 million haul in his first report came from donors giving $200 or less. Any signs that Clinton's fundraising edge is dwindling or she is burning through cash would set off more alarm bells in the party. 
 
__ 
 
FIRST DEBATE 
 
The Oct. 13 debate in Nevada will give voters their first opportunity to measure Clinton on stage against Sanders and the rest of the field. Clinton has avoided directly criticizing Sanders' policy positions or his role in the primaries but her campaign has indicated voters may soon see a contrast between the two candidates. Clinton needs to tread carefully because she will need Sanders' supporters to help her campaign if she wins the nomination. Millions of people have tuned into the first two Republican debates, raising the potential stakes for Democrats. 
 
There could be an element of surprise: CNN will allow Biden to participate even if he decides to become a candidate in the hours before the debate. Clinton's team sees debates as a strong suit for her. But observers remember her struggles, in an October 2007 debate, to answer a question about whether immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be issued driver's licenses. 
 
__ 
 
BENGHAZI TESTIMONY 
 
For months, Clinton has tried to provide public testimony before the panel investigating her response to the Benghazi attack while she was President Obama's top diplomat. She will get that opportunity Oct. 22.  Supporters hope for a reprise of her fiery January 2013 appearance before lawmakers. Clinton's advisers view the October testimony as a chance for her to take on her Republican critics and predict some GOP lawmakers will overreach to the point of bullying her - imagery that could make the inquiry look like a political vendetta and boost her campaign. Still, the appearance could bring more attention to her use of a private email address and server and to questions about whether she exchanged classified information at the time. 
 
__ 
 
THE J-J 
 
If Clinton hopes to project strength in Iowa, the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner is the place to do it. The Oct. 24 dinner typically draws thousands of hardcore Democratic activists. It's where eventual Democratic nominee John Kerry took on Howard Dean in the fall of 2003, and where Obama electrified Democrats in 2007. Some of Clinton's stronger moments during this campaign have come at large party events such as her speech before the New Hampshire state party convention, her address to the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis and her ""Wing Ding"" speech in Iowa, when she railed against Republicans playing ""partisan games."" Clinton's 2007 appearance at the dinner fell flat next to Obama's. How she stacks up in the hall against Sanders and potentially Biden could set the tone for the remainder of the Iowa campaign.

A19,"A Heathcote father sat impassively during a hearing in the Bendigo Magistrates Court on Tuesday, after he was charged with the murder of his three-month-old daughter Alanah​ Rowe.

The baby was rushed to a local hospital after suffering a reported coughing fit on August 29 at a Heathcote home in central Victoria. 

Joby Anthony Rowe, 23, was said to be dealing with ""custody management issues"" when he made a brief court appearance on Tuesday via video link.

Dressed in a black hoodie, Mr Rowe did not apply for bail and will spend Christmas behind bars before his next court appearance on January 20 next year. 

Baby Alanah died on Sunday, August 30, after being flown to Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital in a critical condition.

It has been reported by News Limited that Mr Rowe was feeding his three-month-old daughter on the afternoon of Saturday, August 29, when she started coughing and then began choking and gasping for air.

When the baby's mother, Stephanie Knibbs​, arrived she desperately tried to clear the baby's airway, before noticing blood coming from her mouth and nose, according to a friend of the couple.

The baby was rushed to the local hospital, before an air-ambulance flew her to the Royal Children's Hospital, where she died the following day.

Meanwhile, homicide detectives in Victoria's west are still investigating the suspicious death of an 11-month-old boy.

The baby, believed to be named Israel, died in Hamilton Hospital about 3.50am on Monday, July 13.

Emergency services had been called to his family's home on Strachan Street, Hamilton, about 3am.

No charges have been laid over the boy's death, but police have confirmed that homicide detectives are preparing a report for the coroner.

An autopsy has been carried out, but police have not revealed the nature of the results.

The boy was the youngest of four siblings, three boys and a girl, all aged under eight. 

His mother, Tanita Brenssell​, wrote about her grief on Facebook this month.

""My pain is still raw like it was yesterday. The hurt is unbearable,"" Ms Brenssell wrote.

""I am left with pictures clothes toys and memories. I will never understand fully why this could happen to such a pure innocent soul … a soul I created to put on [this] planet. I will never be the same. My children left with me today are the reason for me not to self destruct.

""Fly high as high can be my Pepe. Mum loves you and I can not wait to hold smell laugh kiss and play with you again.""

A20,"English writer, actor and TV host Stephen Fry is coming to Adelaide for a special event celebrating the 40 th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in South Australia . 
 
The Don Dunstan Foundation and Adelaide Festival Centre are presenting the November 29 talk, which will see the celebrated raconteur and gay rights advocate interviewed by ABC journalist Annabel Crabb. 
 
Fry — best-known as the host of British television quiz show QI and for sketch comedies such as Blackadder and A Bit of Fry and Laurie –  is expected to discuss gay rights, mental health, his love of nature “and whatever else tickles his fancy”. 
 
“He’s just such an amazingly entertaining and spirited person, and he has a set of values that are easily captured in what he talks about,” Dunstan Foundation executive director Donna Harden told Adelaide news wesbite  InDaily today. 
 
“He’s worked very hard for gay rights. He’s been absolutely passionate about that subject.” 
 
Fry’s two-part documentary  Out There , which screened in Australia last year, looked at the lives of gay people in different parts of the world and included a highly confrontational interview with a minister in Uganda’s government at the time it was seeking to make homosexuality a capital crime. 
 
He has also worked to fight the stigma often attached to mental health problems, speaking about his own long battle with bipolar disorder in a program titled The Secret Life of a Manic Depressive as well as in his autobiographies. 
 
Harden said Fry’s interests, including the environment, aligned well with those of the Dunstan Foundation, a charitable trust with a focus on social justice issues. 
 
Fry will be in Australia for most of November, touring the country with his new live show Telling Tales . However, Adelaide is not on the Telling Tales itinerary, so his talk at the Festival Theatre will be the only opportunity to see him here. 
 
Harden said the Dunstan Foundation first approached his management a year ago inviting him to come to South Australia. 
 
“He’s incredibly busy so there’s been a long wait period. I just threw it out there and hoped we would get a response — and not only did we get that, we got a really lovely response. 
 
“He’s sympathetic to the values we stand for and also the fact that it’s a celebration of the 40 th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality.” 
 
Fry married his partner, Elliott Spencer, earlier this year and featured in a short film made by Irish comedians supporting a “yes” vote in Ireland’s gay marriage referendum in May. 
 
Harden said she didn’t know if he would weigh into Australia’s marriage equality debate while here, but added: “He’s a statement in himself … he’s married and I think he’s proud to show that and that’s where his sympathies lie.” 
 
The Don Dunstan Foundation, in association with the Adelaide Festival Centre, will present Stephen Fry, in conversation with Annabel Crabb, at the Festival Theatre  from 5pm-6.30pm on November 29. Tickets will be available through BASS from noon tomorrow.

A23,"Campaigns & Elections Carson Flunks Test on the Constitution Jonathan S. Tobin 2015-09-21 Jonathan S. Tobin/Sept. 21, 2015	40SharesFacebook Twitter Google+ Email Print ALike a chain reaction, the fallout from Donald Trump’s birther mania and anti-Muslim prejudice has affected one of his chief competitors. Trump was unrepentant about accepting a question at a New Hampshire town hall meeting whose premise was that that President Obama was a Muslim and Muslims, in general, were a problem in America. As I noted yesterday, Trump can’t pretend to be an innocent about any of this since. As the nation’s pre-eminent birther, he did as much as anyone to promote these canards. But when Dr. Ben Carson was asked about this kerfuffle on “Meet the Press” yesterday, he had an epic flub. Instead of deflecting a question about whether a president’s faith matters and pivoting to the issues he wants to highlight, Carson followed Trump down the rabbit hole and dug himself even deeper by saying that a Muslim should not be president. While he and his defenders have tried to blame the problem on NBC’s Chuck Todd for asking the question or to spin his way out of that unforced error, this gaffe reveals two things about Carson. One is that he doesn’t have a sophisticated grasp of the problem of Islamist terror that President Obama has largely bungled. The other is that his lack of political smarts is a distinct liability to his party. Let’s first dispense with the “gotcha question” excuse we’re hearing today in Carson’s defense. It’s the journalist’s job to ask tough and probing questions, including those that might embarrass politicians. It’s the politicians’ responsibility to answer those questions in a manner that is not inconsistent with their values as well to do so in a manner that doesn’t them look like idiots. Carson should have rejected the question about presidents and faith out of hand by merely saying that the Constitution makes clear there is no religious test for public office in this republic. Not to mention the fact that there are no Muslims running. If this very smart physician didn’t do that, it’s his fault, not Todd’s. If Carson was trying to say, as some of his friends are claiming today, that what he really meant was that an Islamist who supports terrorist movements or advocates of imposing Sharia law on the nation are not fit for the White House, he would have been on firmer ground. But he didn’t say that. He said “Muslims” per se should be banned without a qualifier. Oddly enough, Carson didn’t flub the birther question when it was posed to him rightly saying that he has no reason to doubt that Obama was born in the United States and is, as he says, a Christian. But, like Trump, who continues to double down on this distraction, Carson couldn’t keep his eye on the ball when it comes to questions about Islam. President Obama has done the nation a great disservice by steadfastly refusing to identify the key element driving those forces that are waging war on America. By continuing to claim that ISIS and al-Qaeda are merely extremists that are not Islamic, the administration has sent a confusing and counter-productive message. It is difficult to wage war on an enemy that is misidentified in this manner and that has undermined the fight against these terrorists. It’s also provided an explanation for why the U.S. effort is failing to make progress against the so-called caliphate despite the president’s pledge last year to “degrade and ultimately destroy” ISIS. But if leading Republican candidates don’t know the difference between Islamists and ordinary Muslims, how can they claim to do any better than Obama? Worries about Islamism and sharia law notwithstanding, there is also something profoundly troubling about a would-be chief executive that speaks at times as if he is unfamiliar with the Constitution that he would pledge to defend. It is not a matter of political correctness, as Trump asserts, to know the right answer to this sort of question. Nor is the fact that a Muslim extremist group like CAIR has gotten some free airtime from denouncing Carson means that he is in the right. No matter what we may think about some branches of Islam, the prohibition against religious tests is absolute and for any candidate to speak as if there is an exception is shameful. Conservatives can carp all they want about Democrats taking cheap shots on this issue, but they are right when they say that to speak of not accepting a Muslim president is morally equivalent to making the same kind of remarks about Catholics and Jews. In recent months, Carson’s soft-spoken tone and decency have masked his tendency to make gaffes. But the Carson who uttered this foolish and offensive line about Muslim presidents is the same person who once spoke of the Obama administration as morally equivalent to the Nazi regime. For all of his brilliance and good qualities, Carson is not ready for prime time and the reaction to his foot-in-mouth moment illustrates how much of a problem he would be as a nominee. As Marco Rubio rightly said when asked the same questions on the Sunday questions shows, Obama was born in this country and is a Christian, and Republicans should move on from this trap and keep focused on the real domestic and foreign policy issues on which Republicans can win. But so long as Trump and Carson provide liberals with this kind of fodder, that won’t happen. Serious conservatives should regard anyone who doesn’t recogniz this truth as having rendered themselves unfit for the presidency.Unlock this and every COMMENTARY article, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.Enjoy every new issue—either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.

Oddly enough, Carson didn’t flub the birther question when it was posed to him rightly saying that he has no reason to doubt that Obama was born in the United States and is, as he says, a Christian. But, like Trump, who continues to double down on this distraction, Carson couldn’t keep his eye on the ball when it comes to questions about Islam. President Obama has done the nation a great disservice by steadfastly refusing to identify the key element driving those forces that are waging war on America. By continuing to claim that ISIS and al-Qaeda are merely extremists that are not Islamic, the administration has sent a confusing and counter-productive message. It is difficult to wage war on an enemy that is misidentified in this manner and that has undermined the fight against these terrorists. It’s also provided an explanation for why the U.S. effort is failing to make progress against the so-called caliphate despite the president’s pledge last year to “degrade and ultimately destroy” ISIS. But if leading Republican candidates don’t know the difference between Islamists and ordinary Muslims, how can they claim to do any better than Obama? Worries about Islamism and sharia law notwithstanding, there is also something profoundly troubling about a would-be chief executive that speaks at times as if he is unfamiliar with the Constitution that he would pledge to defend. It is not a matter of political correctness, as Trump asserts, to know the right answer to this sort of question. Nor is the fact that a Muslim extremist group like CAIR has gotten some free airtime from denouncing Carson means that he is in the right. No matter what we may think about some branches of Islam, the prohibition against religious tests is absolute and for any candidate to speak as if there is an exception is shameful. Conservatives can carp all they want about Democrats taking cheap shots on this issue, but they are right when they say that to speak of not accepting a Muslim president is morally equivalent to making the same kind of remarks about Catholics and Jews. In recent months, Carson’s soft-spoken tone and decency have masked his tendency to make gaffes. But the Carson who uttered this foolish and offensive line about Muslim presidents is the same person who once spoke of the Obama administration as morally equivalent to the Nazi regime. For all of his brilliance and good qualities, Carson is not ready for prime time and the reaction to his foot-in-mouth moment illustrates how much of a problem he would be as a nominee. As Marco Rubio rightly said when asked the same questions on the Sunday questions shows, Obama was born in this country and is a Christian, and Republicans should move on from this trap and keep focused on the real domestic and foreign policy issues on which Republicans can win. But so long as Trump and Carson provide liberals with this kind of fodder, that won’t happen. Serious conservatives should regard anyone who doesn’t recogniz this truth as having rendered themselves unfit for the presidency.Unlock this and every COMMENTARY article, including our entire archive dating back to 1945, and featuring so many classic, epoch-defining articles by some of the very best minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.Enjoy every new issue—either in print, on our responsive website, or on our beautiful, hand-crafted iPad edition, enriched with multimedia and other web-exclusive content.

A23,"Campaigns & Elections Carson Flunks Test on the Constitution Jonathan S. Tobin 2015-09-21 Jonathan S. Tobin/Sept. 21, 2015	40SharesFacebook Twitter Google+ Email Print ALike a chain reaction, the fallout from Donald Trump’s birther mania and anti-Muslim prejudice has affected one of his chief competitors. Trump was unrepentant about accepting a question at a New Hampshire town hall meeting whose premise was that that President Obama was a Muslim and Muslims, in general, were a problem in America. As I noted yesterday, Trump can’t pretend to be an innocent about any of this since. As the nation’s pre-eminent birther, he did as much as anyone to promote these canards. But when Dr. Ben Carson was asked about this kerfuffle on “Meet the Press” yesterday, he had an epic flub. Instead of deflecting a question about whether a president’s faith matters and pivoting to the issues he wants to highlight, Carson followed Trump down the rabbit hole and dug himself even deeper by saying that a Muslim should not be president. While he and his defenders have tried to blame the problem on NBC’s Chuck Todd for asking the question or to spin his way out of that unforced error, this gaffe reveals two things about Carson. One is that he doesn’t have a sophisticated grasp of the problem of Islamist terror that President Obama has largely bungled. The other is that his lack of political smarts is a distinct liability to his party. Let’s first dispense with the “gotcha question” excuse we’re hearing today in Carson’s defense. It’s the journalist’s job to ask tough and probing questions, including those that might embarrass politicians. It’s the politicians’ responsibility to answer those questions in a manner that is not inconsistent with their values as well to do so in a manner that doesn’t them look like idiots. Carson should have rejected the question about presidents and faith out of hand by merely saying that the Constitution makes clear there is no religious test for public office in this republic. Not to mention the fact that there are no Muslims running. If this very smart physician didn’t do that, it’s his fault, not Todd’s. If Carson was trying to say, as some of his friends are claiming today, that what he really meant was that an Islamist who supports terrorist movements or advocates of imposing Sharia law on the nation are not fit for the White House, he would have been on firmer ground. But he didn’t say that. He said “Muslims” per se should be banned without a qualifier. Oddly enough, Carson didn’t flub the birther question when it was posed to him rightly saying that he has no reason to doubt that Obama was born in the United States and is, as he says, a Christian.

A24,"Just before the sun came up on Tuesday, Blue Gum Farm at Euroa – like all stud farms across the country – was bracing itself for newborn foals and pregnant mares. Just before the sun came up on Tuesday, Blue Gum Farm at Euroa – like all stud farms across the country – was bracing itself for newborn foals and pregnant mares, with staff members hoping the next three months go smoothly.

It was September 1, the start of the spring breeding season. The long hours of working out the perfect cross for this mare and that stallion are over. Theory and stud books are put away and sleeves rolled up for months of pregnancy tests and mares bringing new life into the world.

There are many tell-tale signs farms are looking for in the early months of spring. Heavily in-foal mares begin to drip milk, while dry mares – without foals – begin to come into season.

The principal of Blue Gum, Phillip Campbell, said from September 1 his stud farm went into full swing.

""There's a lot happening. We've got mares ready for serving or mating, and then you wait and hope for a positive result. It's a long process, and at the same time we have our staff come in when it's dark to monitor all the mares that are pregnant and waiting to give birth,"" he said.

""They're a specialised team, but you can't stretch your employees around the clock, as 90 per cent of the mares will only give foal in the dark. It's probably nature's way, because they're at their most relaxed at night and there's less chance of predators interfering in their labour.

""It's a ... large operation: first-time mares having foals, former race mares being covered by stallions for the first time, it's very much a hectic time of year.""

Blue Gum is no different from breeding establishments across Australasia, with owners of first-time brood mares waiting anxiously for positive pregnancy tests and others eagerly awaiting the birth of foals.

It is an expensive operation, with owners hoping their filly foal or weanling colt will find group 1 success and make them very wealthy.

The science behind successful pregnancies and trouble-free births is complex.

Veterinary surgeons remain on hand over these three months.

Campbell said: ""There are some extremely expensive mares being covered by extremely valuable stallions.

A27,"Beijing: An online advertisement urging people not to sell their kidneys but instead donate sperm to win the latest iPhone 6s has gone viral in China, media reported. 
 
“No need to sell a kidney… Shanghai sperm bank can make your iPhone 6s dream come true,” said the advertisement which has gone viral on social networking app WeChat this week, reported Global Post. 
 
Those who qualify to donate can receive up to 6,000 yuan. The latest Apple model is expected to cost around 5,288 yuan, the report said. 
 
“Why sell your kidney when you can donate sperm? It’s a great deed that can bring happiness to a whole family,” said microblog Weibo user “Wojiushiwutong”. 
 
A sperm bank in central China’s Hubei Province posted a similar advertisement highlighting a picture of the new rose gold iPhone 6s, a colour created mainly to attract Chinese consumers. 
 
“I don’t like the idea of making money out of sperm donation to buy new iPhones. Sperm donation is a very serious cause for public good,” one Weibo user said. 
 
But a spokesperson with the Shanghai sperm bank told Xinhua the campaign has worked well so far, raising awareness and attracting potential donors. 
 
While there are tens of thousands of infertile couples in China, all sperm banks across the country face donation shortages because many young men are unaware or too embarrassed to donate, forcing the banks to turn to social media.

A28,"(CNN) -  
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent target of some of Jimmy Fallon's barbs, showed an easy rapport with the host on ""The Tonight Show"" Monday night, armed with an amusing anecdote about his New Hampshire visit with the Romneys and the Rubios and joking about the upcoming CNN GOP presidential debate. 
 
He also took a couple lighthearted shots at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. 

Declaring he was ""fired up"" to be on the show, the 2016 candidate opened the interview by insisting on participating in one of the show's notorious lip sync battles. But Christie was quickly shut down after launching into the opening lines of ""Born in the U.S.A."" by his famously beloved Bruce Springsteen, with Fallon slamming the buzzer and declaring Christie the winner. 

Christie, winking at his slipping poll numbers, quipped, ""Wow, my first first place! That's really good."" 

The New Jersey governor also shared a story from his stay at Mitt Romney's lakeside home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, over the Fourth of July weekend, during which he was accompanied by fellow 2016 GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio and his family. Christie described a spontaneous boating trip to a local ice cream store gone awry, whereupon arriving at the shop with a small horde of children and grandchildren, he, Romney and Rubio discovered, uncomfortably, that they had forgotten to bring enough money to pay for the crowd's ice cream demands. 

""So Mitt Romney turns to me and he says, 'By the way, do you have any money?' Mitt Romney! Right?,"" Christie joked. ""I said, 'No, I don't have any money, I didn't know we were going for ice cream.'"" He continued, ""So he turns to Rubio and he says, 'Do you have any money?' Rubio goes, 'I don't have any money.'"" 

Then came the punchline: ""So...our wives are walking behind us, and finally we hear a voice from behind going, 'Don't worry, would-be presidents, I have it handled.' And it was Ann Romney. She had the money."" 

The would-be president also addressed the domination of the crowded 2016 GOP field by Donald Trump during the interview. Asked by Fallon if he had expected Trump's surge in the polls, Christie sarcastically replied ""Oh, no, I completely expected that -- didn't you?"" 

The governor then teased the GOP frontrunner over his notorious self-confidence, breaking into his best Trump impression to add, ""Of course. Everything he does is fabulous, spectacular, wonderful, amazing."" 

Later in the interview, Christie discussed his performance in the first GOP presidential debate and his plans for the second debate, scheduled to take place on CNN on September 16. 

Complaining about the lack of opportunities to speak, he noted that during the first debate ""There was one point where I went twenty questions in a row without being asked a question. And that's hard."" 

""I'm standing up there next to Marco Rubio and we're looking at each other and going, 'Are we still here?'"" 

But Christie promised to make his presence felt at the second debate. ""By the way, stay tuned on September 16th. We may be changing tactics. If I go -- if I get to fifteen questions in a row -- count them at home -- if I get that fifteen in a row, they're gonna go 'Uh-oh, he's going nuclear now,'"" adding ""if I turn green and get the hulk thing going.""

A31,"Verint ® Systems Inc. ( NASDAQ: VRNT ) today announced enhancements to its Verint 
      Situational Awareness Platform ™ , including the 
      incorporation of advanced solutions to help organizations gain 
      comprehensive situational awareness while driving rapid incident 
      response and enhanced field communications. This evolutionary 
      situational awareness platform is designed to provide security 
      executives and operators actionable intelligence and better insight by 
      incorporating unified situation monitoring, dispatch and incident 
      response, live field communications and real-time citizen input. 

The Verint Situational Awareness Platform enables command-and-control 
      operators to play a valued and active role in incident management and 
      response by notifying users of emergency situations based on their 
      location. Additionally, data from mobile devices can be sent to the 
      command center, enabling the general public to report security concerns 
      and issues in real-time in support of the overall well-being of the 
      communities they live and work in. Using the Verint solution, first 
      responders and security personnel can leverage the Actionable 
      Intelligence ® it provides to gain a better understanding and 
      clearer picture of incidents through immediate information sharing in 
      the field. 
   
The extension of the Verint Situational Awareness Platform is 
      transforming the way users engage with responders, field resources, 
      other public safety stakeholders and the general public. It combines 
      situational awareness with built-in dispatch and bi-directional 
      information flow for continuous communication between citizens, intake 
      operators, field resources and command center personnel, and allows 
      responders to provide mobile reporting through video streaming and live 
      images. This correlates information from multiple sources into a single 
      platform for a unified view, enabling faster, more intelligent 
      decision-making in routine and emergency events. Additionally, the 
      solution can alert command-and-control operators from sensors and 
      provide Geographical Information Science (GIS) mapping, live 
      surveillance and other location information to help identify the closest 
      resources to dispatch for more rapid, efficient response. Comprehensive 
      incident reporting with multimedia options offers a further set of 
      enhancements to support post-incident investigations. 

Among the latest enhancements to the Verint Situational Awareness 
      Platform are Dispatch Manager, Mobile Reporter, and Mobile Responder. 
      These capabilities, along with Verint Situation Manager, work in 
      conjunction to provide information through integration with intelligent 
      sensors and data sources, including big data analysis, video

A34,"A hospital will investigate the circumstance surrounding a baby's death Stacey Barrell gave birth to baby Charlotte at 5am on August 11, 2015 Her baby tragically died 10 hours later at Palmerston North Hospital Ms Barrell and her partner Kris Harding say a senior doctor 'stuffed up'  
A grieving mother with a medical history of birth complications said she was rushed into an emergency caesarean section too late and will never know if her baby's death could have been avoided. 

Stacey Barrell, who gave birth to baby Charlotte at 5am on August 11 at Palmerston North Hospital in New Zealand, and her partner Kris Harding were distraught when their baby Charlotte died just 10 hours after she was born. 

The pair are convinced a senior doctor and a midwife at the hospital made the wrong call by delaying Ms Barrell's caesarean section. 
   
Stacey Barrell (left), who gave birth to baby Charlotte at 5am on August 11 at Palmerston North Hospital, and her partner Kris Harding (left) were distraught when their baby Charlotte died just 10 hours after she was born 
   
Mr Harding said he sang to his daughter Charlotte and cuddled her before she passed away 

Ms Barrell was rushed to hospital after her baby's movements slowed down, feeling panicked after her previous pregnancies resulted in her babies inhaling meconium - also known as the baby's first faeces. 

Ms Barrell and her partner told Daily Mail Australia they repeatedly asked doctors to conduct a caesarean section. 
 
However, after a blood test on her baby was conducted Ms Barrell said she was induced and told a natural birth might be fine. 

'They decided to see how I go with a natural birth. I was tired and confused and hoped my midwife would explain my medical history because we had discussed me having a c-section,' said Ms Barrell. 

Ms Barrell said based on her past two pregnancies and the fact her two-year-old daughter Zoe has brain damage due to a complicated pregnancy - Zoe inhaled meconium during birth and stopped breathing - a caesarean section should have occurred straight away. 
   
Mr Harding's other children made him a memory box to honour baby Charlotte who only lived 10 hours 
   
Mr Harding's Facebook messgae about his bitter- sweet Father's Day after baby Charlotte passed away 

'It wasn't until my baby's heart rate stopped that they rushed me into to an emergency c-section. That was too late,' she said. 

'I was going through the traumatic loss of a child and it was not until I looked back that I realised they failed me.  

'All the staff were really good with us but the senior doctor and the midwife who made the call not to take me in for a c-section earlier stuffed up.' 

Mr Harding struggled with the death of his daughter who he said passed away peacefully in his arm as he sang to her.

Like his partner, he believes a senior doctor failed to assess Ms Barrell's case properly. 

'I am just so upset with that senior doctor. He actually admitted he didn't even read Stacey's medical record before he made decisions. She should have been taken into have a c-section straight away,' Mr Harding said.  

An investigation into the circumstances surrounding baby Charlotte's death is under way by the both MidCentral District Health Board and the police, who are acting on behalf of the coroner.  
   
Mr Harding shared a heartfelt Faceook post as he deals with losing a second child 

When Daily Mail Australia contacted Palmerston North Hospital in New Zealand for comment, the hospital referred to a previous statement made to Fairfax. 

Specialist community and regional services operations director Nicholas Glubb stold Stuff.co.nz that care provided to Charlotte and Ms Barrell is being reviewed. 

'When we have the information and findings of the reviews we will make that information available to the family. 
   
Mr Harding (left) and Ms Barrell (right) told Daily Mail Australia they hope no other parent experiences what they went through  

'We expect these reviews to be complete by late November 2015 given the structured nature of the review and the complexities of the issues involved,' Mr Glubb said.  

Ms Barrell and Mr Harding said they will continue to fight so this incident is not repeated. 

'We value the staff at the hospital but are upset that a senior doctor and midwife ignored us. I want doctors and midwives to be more vigilant and hospitals not to be over-crowded. 

'No parent should have to experience this,' Mr Harding told Daily Mail Australia.

A35,"Any internal memos about Maxim  ditching its bro-tastic, raunchy image in favor of a more fashionable, woman-friendly perspective seem to have missed the inboxes of the staff at the magazine’s Korean edition. The cover of the September issue of Maxim  Korea features Korean movie star Kim Byung-Ok, who is known for portraying dangerous villains, puffing on a cigarette. There’s only one word to sum up his noir-ish fashion style: Cool. 
 
And what makes that so disturbing to some is that Byung-Ok is smoking his cancer stick while standing next to a car that has a woman’s duct-taped lower legs hanging out of the trunk—and the trunk’s lid is resting on top of her legs. 
 
“So girls like ‘bad guys’? This is what a bad guy looks like. Dying for him, right?"" reads the copy on the mag’s cover next to Byung-OK, reads an  Avaaz petition  started by a Korea resident named Megal P. The petition asks  Maxim  Korea to remove the issue from stores and recall any sold issues. “Is it ok to capitalize on the ongoing pain of real victims, just for sexual jokes and beautification of distorted male images?” wrote the author. More than 9,400 people have signed it so far. 
 
But Megal P. isn’t stopping with a hypothetical question and the request for the issue to be recalled: “We also plead the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and the Korea Publication Ethics Commission to make a public announcement regarding the issue and come up with measures to stop a next potential case similar to this,” reads the petition. 
   
(Photo: Facebook) 
   
A multi-page photo spread inside the issue also shows pictures of a woman in a car trunk, along with “an abandoned dead body in a black plastic bag, and eyes looking up the perpetrator,” Megal P. wrote. A video featuring Byung-Ok that was posted on Maxim  Korea's YouTube channel last week also shows footage of the actor looking down at something in a trunk and then shutting the lid. 
 
RELATED:  If Kids Think the Models Are Dead, There’s Definitely a Problem With Fashion Ads 
 
The implication of the photos and video is that Byung-Ok may have murdered a woman and is having a smoke while disposing her body.  
 
The petition’s author cites statistics about violence and sexual assault against women as reasons the cover is irresponsible. According to the 2010 Korea National Survey of Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence , 53.8 percent of respondents who had been married experienced spousal abuse in the previous year, and 16.7 percent suffered physical abuse. Korea is also ranked 117th out of 142 countries on the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index 2014 , which measures gaps between women and men in areas such as health, education, economy, and politics.   
 
In a statement to Women You Should Know , Youngbi Lee, the editor-in-chief of Maxim Korea defended the cover as depicting the actor “directing a scene of film crime.” 
 
RELATED: What If Fashion Ads Objectified Men the Same Scary Way They Do Women? 
 
“As you can see, in the context of the cover we did depict the crime of murder and body abandonment in a film noir way, but there’s no hint of a sexual offense in the picture, and no fantasizing of sex crimes either,” wrote Lee. “Unlike some people’s concerns, we never intended to beautify sex crimes as sex fantasy. Films direct scenes for delivering a story and mood. We hope you can also see the cover as expressing a scene of crime to show the contexts of this issue.” 
 
The petition's author  doesn't seem to be buying Maxim  Korea's rationalizations.

<<<<<<< HEAD
“ Maxim targets adult males and that’s no secret.

A37,"Cindy Lehmann was a natural mother 

CINDY Lehmann was a natural mother.

In 26 years of foster caring, she and husband Rob Lehmann welcomed more than 300 children into their home.

Together they raised six of their biological children and took three of their foster children into permanent care.

But tragically the 58-year-old Warrnambool woman’s life was cut short when she died after a horrific crash in August.

Mrs Lehmann has been described as an incredible woman who provided love and a safe place for children who had been forgotten by the world.

With a quiet dignity, Mr Lehmann told The Standard how on the night of the accident their son Bo, who lived on Rooneys Road, rang and asked for a ride into work.

Mrs Lehmann and her son Joel drove the less than five-minute trip to Bo’s house and headed to the Rooneys Road and Raglan Parade intersection.

“Fortunately Bo and Joel were on the passenger side of the car - Bo was in the middle seat and Joel in the front seat,” Mr Lehmann said.

“She stopped at the lights, she looked up the road to see it was all clear. There were no traffic lights there.

“She looked up and must have thought it was clear. She went across the intersection and the next thing Bo must have turned around and he said ‘truck’ and with that … bang.

“The truck pushed the car and hit her driver’s side. Bo tried to grab the hand brake to stop it from moving or spinning.”

Mr Lehmann said 14-year-old Joel bravely ran back to Bo’s house to call for help while Bo, 24, stayed by his mum’s side.

“I got to the intersection and I just saw all the ambulances,” he said.

“They’d gotten her out of the car. I just couldn’t believe it. The car was in a U shape.

“She had severe head injuries and we went to emergency in Warrnambool.

“When I finally saw her, she was in a bad way.”

Mrs Lehmann was later airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a critical condition.

Mr Lehmann said early CT scans didn’t reveal the extent of her injuries because of swelling.

“She also had fractured ribs, a fractured jaw, a fractured elbow – all things that could get better,” he said.

“The main thing was the trauma to her head. It was just a harrowing week. We were in there talking to her, telling her, ‘wake up, Mum’.”

Mr Lehmann was on his way home to Warrnambool to check on his family when he got a call to return to the hospital because the MRI results were back and they weren’t good.

“My heart just dropped,” he said.

“All the thinking there might have been some glimmer of hope.

“We had the big family meeting and they said her whole brain was severely damaged beyond repair and she’d never wake up.

“We all sat down and had to make a big decision.

“She always said to me, ‘if I end up like that, I don’t want to live like that’ - and I’m the same. I don’t want to live relying on a ventilator to keep me alive, but it was a pretty hard decision to make.

“With the vibration she was hit, the whole brain shook and damaged everything in the brain, which she wouldn't wake up from. It’s really hard.”

Mrs Lehmann died two days before the couple’s 40th wedding anniversary.

Mr and Mrs Lehmann met at a fellowship function and their relationship soon blossomed.

In the early days of their marriage, Mr Lehmann worked full-time and Mrs Lehmann did family day care. It was from that work Mrs Lehmann saw there were children in need of a loving and secure home.

“She turned around to me one day and said, ‘How about we do foster care?’,” Mr Lehmann said.

“We only had a young family then and the kids were more or less brought up with foster care, but we did talk to them about it. It just snowballed and we’ve been doing it ever since.

“We were a good team and we just felt sorry to see the plight of these kids. More than anything you could just see the way they came to her.

“We just wanted to give them that care that they didn’t have.”

Mr Lehmann said although foster care work was challenging, the rewards always outweighed any difficult experiences.

“We’ve had our hard cases - the real demanding cases and some we couldn’t handle,” he said.

“We did everything we possibly we could.

“We’ve had some that left us that have gone on the downward spiral. We’ve had phone calls from some who have gone on to be doctors and just blossomed with their careers and lives. That just made us absolutely happy.”

Mrs Lehmann was recognised as carer of the year in the statewide Robert Clark Memorial awards in 2012.

Foster care team leader Marion Noye, from Brophy Family and Youth Services, said Mrs Lehmann had the ability to accept and love all the children who came into her care.

She said those incredible skills had been passed on by Mr and Mrs Lehmann to their other children.

“You always knew that when you placed a child in the Lehmann house they were going to be safe and happy,” she said.

Brophy chief executive Francis Broekman said Mrs Lehmann was an extraordinary woman who opened her house to children who had often been forgotten and were unable to live at home.

“She offered them love and unconditional support,” he said.

“She and Rob offered their home to children and were able to repair trauma in them.

“They showed them there were people in the world who loved them for who they were.”

More than 500 people attended Mrs Lehmann’s funeral on September 11 and she was celebrated and remembered as a kind and caring woman who was always doing things for other people.

“It was heartwarming that she was loved by so many but very sad that someone was taken who was so special to me and everybody else,” Mr Lehmann said.

Mrs Lehmann also volunteered as a football trainer at Merrivale, Old Collegians and later at Koroit.

“She loved doing that. It was just her break to get away from the family,” Mr Lehmann said.

“She was a wonderful, caring person and she just thought of everybody she was involved with.”

Mr Lehmann said he planned to continue the foster care work and he was grateful for the support from family, friends and the community.

“I just want to move on doing exactly what she would like me to do,” he said.

“It’d be nothing to come home at night and see two new faces as I walked in the door and I’d say, ‘Oh Cindy who are these?’ and she’d say, ‘These are so and so. We’ve only got them for a week’.

“Then that week would turn into weeks and months. We’d bring them into our family and bring them up the same way we brought up our kids.

“She was just a natural mother around the home. She was a wonderful mum.”

A39,"Arab Spring has predictably been an utter disaster. 
 
By undermining the legitimacy of existing authority, it has turned the middle east into a sea of blood and fire, the worst cases being Syria and Libya. 
 
Middle Easterners are mostly of inferior races, and at the best of times, it is hard for them to maintain the basic functions of a modern society, hard to keep the electricity running, the water running, the sewage off the streets, and all that.  To operate this quite ordinary stuff in a society dominated by an inferior race requires a fair bit of arrogant confident elitism and a cheerful willingness to smack grossly inferior people around to keep them from mischief.  Arab Spring has been democratic and anti elitist.  Thus most of the anti Bashar Assad groups in Syria just cannot keep that stuff functioning, and keep begging the horrid evil tyrant Bashar Assad to keep that stuff operating for them. 
 
Near as I can figure, the major reasons that Bashar Assad is a horrible tyrant is that he stops stupid people from doing stupid things and he will not let them rape and murder those of non Muslim minorities. 
 
Oddly, Obama and the Cathedral press have unshaken confidence that Obama is on the correct side of history.  From time to time they confidently predict that Putin will fail unless he overthrows Bashar Assad for the Cathedral, after many years of disastrous failure by the Cathedral in its efforts to overthrow Bashar Assad. 
 
Obama and the New York Times and the rest live in an echo chamber, utterly impervious to outside reality.  Their policy cannot be a disaster, because they are on the right side of history. 
 
The natural outcome of democracy is that each tribe votes for  its tribal interest.  The result is unacceptable to all the minority tribes.  War ensues, unless the majority group has a natural advantage in military struggle as well as voting, unless the majority group is the clearly superior group.  If you have democracy without war, it is because you have an ethnically homogeneous society, or someone is rigging the system to produce acceptable results. 
 
Bashar Assad’s strength is that his religion is the only religion in Syria, other than Christianity, that is tolerant enough that it can be trusted to refrain from massacring minorities and his political organization is the only one that has the basic competence to keep the basic services of a modern society functioning and the will to keep the hands of subhumans off those basic services. 
 
The Cathedral congratulates itself that it is rule by smart superior people, but rule by smart superior people was an unprincipled exception, which exception has now been rolled back . 
 
The effects of rule by stupid people are most immediately apparent at your DMV department, at your airport security screening, and in Syria.

Republicans in the US Congress opposing the Iran nuclear agreement are not giving up despite losing to Democrats this week, they are plotting additional attacks to undercut the deal, a report says. 

On Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked a Republican resolution to reject the historic Vienna accord between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries, ensuring that the deal can be implemented without Obama having to use his veto power. 

“This vote is a victory for diplomacy, for American national security, and for the safety and security of the world,” President Barack Obama said after the vote. 

Republican senators, who only a few months earlier vowed to muster 67 votes to override a presidential veto, fell two votes short needed to break a Democratic filibuster. 

But, in the House of Representatives, Republicans succeeded to pass a resolution against the Iran agreement by 162 to 269 votes on Friday. 

Disgrace in the House 
Former Democratic Senator Mike Gravel 
The House vote, however, is symbolic that will have no consequence for the implementation of the nuclear agreement, reached between Iran and the P5+1 -- the US, Britain, Russia, China, France, and Germany -- in Vienna in mid-July. 

“The fact that the House voted for this, all they have shown is their political opinions, it has no validity in law and it’s a disgrace,” Former Democratic Senator Mike Gravel told Press TV on Saturday. 

“It is clearly led by the AIPAC’s influence on the House members and the Congress,” added Gravel, a candidate in the 2008 US presidential election. 

'We’ll use every tool' 
John Boehner (L) with Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel 
According to the Washington-based The Hill newspaper, Republicans in both chambers are now conspiring to launch new attacks to either undermine the accord or force Democrats to cast the same vote all over again. 

“This debate is far from over and, frankly, it's just beginning,” House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, vowed this week. 

“This is a bad deal with decades-long consequences for the security of the American people and our allies,” he declared. 

“And we'll use every tool at our disposal to stop, slow and delay this agreement from being fully implemented,” added Boehner, who earlier this year even invited the Israeli premier to Washington, DC to speak against the Iran deal. 

One more vote on Tuesday  
US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 
In the Senate, minutes after Democrats filibustered legislation opposing the agreement, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said senators will vote on the Iran deal one more time on Tuesday. 

“We’ll revisit the issue next week, and see if maybe any folks want to change their minds,” the visibly shaken McConnell said on Thursday. 

And his deputy, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters, “It will be all Iran next week.” 

“There are going to be more votes,” he said. “There will be other opportunities for people to change their mind next week, hopefully after they hear from their constituents. 

Lawsuit threat against Obama 
US President Barack Obama 
Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Boehner threatened to sue Obama in order to stop him from finalizing the Iran deal. 

He said during a news conference on Capitol Hill that legal action is “an option that’s very possible.” 

“If you read the provisions in [the congressional review law], it’s pretty clear that the president has not complied,” the Republican said. 

Republicans hollow posturing

Analysts, however, say that Republicans cannot stop the historic Vienna accord now; they are only hollow posturing to gain money from the Israel lobby. 

Republican attempts such as holding a secondary vote or suing Obama are “all just hollow posturing on the part of the Republicans for money from the Israel lobby primarily, but also trying to create some type of issue for the upcoming presidential election,” E. Michael Jones told Press TV on Thursday. 

Europe pulled this off

Jones, former professor and editor of Culture Wars magazine, also revealed that the European states involved in the nuclear negotiations with Iran warned Congress to approve the agreement or the Europeans would lift sanctions unilaterally. 

“The European component to this deal sent a delegation to the United States’ Congress and said ‘if you do this [disapprove of the agreement], we’re leaving, we’re out of here, we’re going to lift the sanctions unilaterally,’” he stated.

A43,"Their relationship isn’t going to the dogs, but Cambridge residents Liz Allen and Jonathan Donaldson hope their wedding reception will. The couple, scheduled to tie the knot Sept. 26 at the Yarmouth New Church on Route 6A, posted an ad on Craigslist asking local owners of bulldogs, pugs or Boston terriers to bring their pets to the outdoor reception immediately after the ceremony. “I didn’t know if anyone would respond,” said Allen. “There’s got to be quite a few people in the area who have—we joke about it—any dog with chops.” The family fascination with jowly breeds began with Donaldson’s son Gus, and quickly spread to daughter Anouk, Donaldson himself, and Allen. “He always liked dogs, but the bulldog obsession started when he was about nine years old,” said Allen. “We just sort of developed this family joke. We have songs we sing about bulldogs.” The couple is hoping to have a lawn filled with dogs to surprise the kids after the wedding. “It’s a little silly, but the wedding is going to be just very casual and fun, with family from all over the country,” said Allen. “I think they’d just love the surprise of, they come out of the church, and there’s just all these bulldogs around.” “It’s the kind of place where any kind of wedding can happen,” said Humberto Cordero, a member of the Yarmouth New Church Preservation Foundation. “It’s a kind of all-takers venue for events of all sorts, because it’s not a church. But it is a church. That’s the wonderful thing about it.” Cordero, a friend of the couple who will also officiate the wedding, suggested the unique building, formerly the home of Yarmouth’s Swedenborgian congregation, now a secular venue for art exhibits, musical performances, and all manner of other events. He said ideas like the couple’s bulldog reception fit well with the New Church’s openness to ceremonies of all kinds. “We take the weird or the very straight,” Cordero said. “It’s a very flexible space. For the people who are looking for a storybook wedding, it’s sort of a storybook part of the Cape. It’s a very unique spot. I don’t think there’s anything like it on the Cape.” Cordero said he hopes people respond to the couple’s invitation. “It’ll be interesting as they come out of the church, as they come down the steps, whether we’re going to have a little doggy party.

A43,"Their relationship isn’t going to the dogs, but Cambridge residents Liz Allen and Jonathan Donaldson hope their wedding reception will. The couple, scheduled to tie the knot Sept. 26 at the Yarmouth New Church on Route 6A, posted an ad on Craigslist asking local owners of bulldogs, pugs or Boston terriers to bring their pets to the outdoor reception immediately after the ceremony. “I didn’t know if anyone would respond,” said Allen. “There’s got to be quite a few people in the area who have—we joke about it—any dog with chops.” The family fascination with jowly breeds began with Donaldson’s son Gus, and quickly spread to daughter Anouk, Donaldson himself, and Allen. “He always liked dogs, but the bulldog obsession started when he was about nine years old,” said Allen. “We just sort of developed this family joke. We have songs we sing about bulldogs.” The couple is hoping to have a lawn filled with dogs to surprise the kids after the wedding. “It’s a little silly, but the wedding is going to be just very casual and fun, with family from all over the country,” said Allen. “I think they’d just love the surprise of, they come out of the church, and there’s just all these bulldogs around.” “It’s the kind of place where any kind of wedding can happen,” said Humberto Cordero, a member of the Yarmouth New Church Preservation Foundation. “It’s a kind of all-takers venue for events of all sorts, because it’s not a church. But it is a church. That’s the wonderful thing about it.” Cordero, a friend of the couple who will also officiate the wedding, suggested the unique building, formerly the home of Yarmouth’s Swedenborgian congregation, now a secular venue for art exhibits, musical performances, and all manner of other events. He said ideas like the couple’s bulldog reception fit well with the New Church’s openness to ceremonies of all kinds. “We take the weird or the very straight,” Cordero said. “It’s a very flexible space. For the people who are looking for a storybook wedding, it’s sort of a storybook part of the Cape. It’s a very unique spot. I don’t think there’s anything like it on the Cape.” Cordero said he hopes people respond to the couple’s invitation. “It’ll be interesting as they come out of the church, as they come down the steps, whether we’re going to have a little doggy party.

A46,"In short, the same ol’ same plagued Tampa Bay this week ― the pitching staff wasn’t able to hold the leads they were given. Consider this: the Rays are now 18-31 in games decided in the seventh inning or later, and they have either held a lead or came back to tie the score in 12 of their last 14 losses. Nevertheless, they still endeavored. 
As with any good win probability graph, the past week was chock full of ups and downs for the Tampa Bay Rays. And though they were in every game, with the exception of Saturday’s less than stellar shellacking at the hands of the Boston Red Sox, the Rays only came away with two tallies in the win column. Ouch.

In short, the same ol’ same plagued Tampa Bay this week ― the pitching staff wasn’t able to hold the leads they were given. Consider this: the Rays are now 18-31 in games decided in the seventh inning or later, and they have either held a lead or came back to tie the score in 12 of their last 14 losses. Nevertheless, they still endeavored.

Here’s your weekly Rays recap.
Monday

Drew Smyly took the mound against his former team on Labor Day, and allowed the long ball to get the best of him. That’s not to say he started the game poorly, rather Smyly tossed two excellent innings to start the game. The lefty spotted his fastball well, especially up in the zone, and paired it with his off-speed stuff at the bottom of the zone ― racking up a couple strikeouts, while giving up a pair of hits up the middle.

Yet in the third inning, he surrendered a soft double near the left-field line to Anthony Gose, then left a letter high 1-2 slider to Rajai Davis, who deposited it over the wall in left-field. In a bout of déjà vu, Nick Castellanos led off Detroit’s half of the fifth inning with a double on another hanging slider, and James McCann crushed an errant cutter to left, putting Le Tigre up by two.

In spite of Evan Longoria and JP Arencibia’s homers, which allowed the team to knot the game at four, Brandon Gomes hung a slider to Davis which found a new home in the left field stands.

Tampa Bay didn’t get a runner into scoring position until the ninth against the Tigers bullpen, and by that point it was too late. The Rays fell 5-4.

On the bright side of things, Logan Forsythe was named the AL player of the week. Forsythe hit .545 (12-22) with five runs scored, five doubles, one triple, and two walks in six games the week prior.
Tuesday

Tuesday featured more of the same, although with 100% more extra innings baseball. Erasmo Ramirez got the start for the Rays, and aside from a third inning solo shot off the bat of Rajai Davis, the righty sailed through the front five on just 72 pitches (a little more than 14 pitches per inning). Ramirez racked up nine strikeouts (six whiffs) in that time, while allowing three base runners on three hits. The happy one’s change-up was really working for him, and he made a couple of the Tigers’ big boppers ― namely Ian Kinsler and Miguel Cabrera ― look foolish on a pair of well located off-speed offerings.

Tampa Bay took a 5-1 lead in the sixth. Kevin Kiermaier worked a leadoff walk off Matt Boyd, and J.P. Arencibia moved him to third on a single to right. Grady Sizemore both drove in a run and moved Arencibia to third on a single to right. Tampa Bay scored three more runs on singles by Longoria, Logan Forsythe, and Tim Beckham. The lead, however, was short lived.

The wheels fell off for Ramirez in the fourth after he allowed three consecutive hard hit singles to Anthony Gose, Kinsler, and Cabrera. Erasmo got yanked in favor of Matt Andriese, who walked in Martinez after a nine pitch at-bat. Andriese has now allowed 12 runs (11 earned) in seven appearances and 10-1/3 innings since August 19th. Why Cash chose to go with him in this situation is well beyond the realm of my understanding.

The Rays had a lead when Alex Colome took the mound with the bases loaded and one out in the sixth. Colome put down Nick Castellanos looking, then hit James McCann in the head by a pitch, plating a run. He then gave up a two-run single to left, allowing Detroit to knot the game at five. Longoria was apparently unaware that the runner had stopped on the play. He cut off the throw from Sizemore to the plate, and never noticed that the runner stopped halfway between home and third. He, instead, caught McCann in a rundown between second and third, consequently allowing a run to score.

The scoring went back and forth and Tampa Bay eventually took a 7-7 tie into extras. They, however, walked away with an 8-7 loss in 13 innings after Davis hit a sac-fly into left. OF Grady Sizemore made with a Little League worthy throw to the cutoff man (Longoria) in an attempt to force a play at the plate. But alas the throw wasn’t competitive, and the winning run crossed the plate. The loss in extras became the 10th consecutive for Tampa Bay, the most in a single season since the Houston Astros dropped 11 in 2012.
Wednesday

Fret not Rays’ fans, the boys ended a disappointing 4-5 road trip with an impressive 8-0 win over Detroit. Up by three in the sixth, Tampa Bay extended its lead in the after Logan Forsythe and Tim Beckham hit a pair of homers, chasing. For Beckham, 49% of his hits this season have gone for extra bases. Not one to be left out from the hit show, J.P. Arencibia belted a seventh inning solo shot off reliever Buck Farmer. It was the 18th homer by a Rays’ catcher this year ― two shy of a club record. Finally, Mahtook capped the long ball fiesta when he homered off Jeff Ferrell later in the frame.

Odorizzi clearly did the devils work against Miggy and company by tossing six shutout innings, scattering six hits and fanning six along the way. And though he got himself into a man at third and one-out situation in the third inning ― after Anthony Gose converted a double into three bases ― and a first and second with none-out rally in the fifth, Odorizzi made a couple of big pitches to force a popper out of J.D. Martinez, and a swinging strikeout of Miguel Cabrera (respectively) to get out of both unscathed.
Friday

Editor's Note: Danny is that you?


    




Seen in the stands down the right-field line on Friday.

The Rays returned home to start a three-game series against the worst team in the AL East, the Boston Red Sox. Chris Archer battled to a 5+ IP/5 H/3 ER/2 BB/8 K line on 108 pitches.

Archer started the sixth with a two run lead, yet Tampa Bay ended the frame down by one. The righty allowed an infield single through the hole at short by Xander Bogaerts, before David Ortiz blooped a single into center, putting runners at the corners with none out. After 108 pitches, Rays skipper Kevin Cash pulled Archer in favor of LHP Enny Romero, who entered to face a pair of lefties.

Travis Shaw welcomed Romero by lining a 2-2 cutter to right for an RBI double. Pablo Sandoval knotted the game at three by hitting an 0-2 single toward short, where Asdrubal Cabrera made a diving stop. Yet Cabrera couldn’t fire off an accurate throw to Richie Shaffer at first, resulting in a runners on the corners with one out situation. Brandon Gomes replaced Romero, and a pair of fly balls (including a Ryan Hanigan sac-fly) brought home Shaw with the lead run.

Junichi Tazawa took the mound with a one run lead in the bottom of the eighth. Evan Longoria quickly fell behind Tazawa before taking a 2-2 pitch to right-center for a double. Needing to come up big, Forsythe plated the tying run on a single to right, then was promptly wild pitched to second. A simple tie wouldn’t do, and Cabrera belted a two-run homer (his 12th) to center for a two-run lead.

The Rays weren’t done! Steven Souza Jr. beat out an infield single to the swarthy Pablo Sandoval at third, then was wild pitched to second before stealing his way to third. Not to be left out, JP Arencibia leveled a monster shot to section 143 (cough, three feet to my left) in left field off Noe Ramirez, the third pitcher of the inning.

Your browser does not support frames.

If you squint your eyes, you can see me fist pump in joy, just behind the guy who caught Arencibia's bomb. It was truly my Pauly D. moment. Tampa Bay ultimately walked away victorious, taking the first game of the series 8-4.
Saturday

Another game, another career milestone at the hands of the Rays. Matt Moore got the start and laid a 5 IP/9 H/8 ER/1 BB/3 K/4 HR egg, which included David Ortiz’s 500th homer. Per Dave Haller (Tampa Bay Rays director of communications) it was Ortiz’s sixth career multi-HR game at Tropicana Field, tying Carlos Pena for most all-time. Kevin Cash said they wouldn’t read too much into Moore’s outing; his stuff was good but he poorly located his pitches. He is expected make his next start as scheduled. Still, one can’t help but wonder why Nathan Karns didn’t take over for Moore ― you know, since he was named as Moore’s caddy.
Sunday

Drew Smyly made his second start in a week’s time amidst questions of which Drew might take the mound. After all, the lefty has alternated between good and bad starts since returning from the DL. Smyly silenced the critics by posting a dominant 6 IP/4 H/0 R/2 BB/11 K gem on 97 pitches (60 strikes). Sure, the southpaw got himself into five full counts. However, he also came back with big pitches in three of those situations, collecting a pair of swinging strikeouts and a ground ball out.

Yet, 35 year-old LHP Rich Hill proved to be an equally formidable opponent in his first start since 2009, holding Tampa Bay to just one hit in seven strong innings. Only three batters reached against Hill on a walk, a hit, and a hit by pitch of Richie Shaffer.

Both teams traded relievers back and fourth, yet neither relinquished a run, and into extras the ballgame went for the second time in a week. Adding insult to injury, only two other Rays reached (on a pair of 10th inning walks) until Steven Souza Jr. smoked a double up the left field line in the 11th. Still, they couldn’t push past the winning run.

After Enny Romero dealt three consecutive hits to load the bases with one out, Kevin Cash called upon Andrew Bellatti, who promptly gave up a two-run liner into left, handing Boston the go ahead lead in the 13th. In the end the Rays fell in extra innings for 11th time this season. They ended the day four games under .500, tying their low water marks for the season.

A47,"She has been hiding her face during public appearances for years, but Sia Furler continues to go to bizarre lengths to disguise herself. 

This time the Chandelier hit maker kept her appearance under wraps by dressing up like a human birthday present. 

The 39-year-old was the lady of the hour as she attended the Miu Miu Women's Tales Dinner during the 72nd Venice Film Festival at Ca' Corner della Regina in Venice, Italy on Thursday. 

   
   
Now you Sia, now you don't! Sia Furler kept her appearance under wraps by dressing up like a human birthday present during the 72nd Venice Film Festival at Ca' Corner della Regina in Venice, Italy on Thursday 

Sporting a peroxide blonde bob wig that covered the entirety of her face, the ARIA award winner – who was a major draw card at the dinner, headlining a talk on the night - topped off the unusual hairstyle with a large red bow. 
 
Sia was even more playful with her look, as she covered her locks with an assortment of colourful polka-dot stickers which created the illusion of looking like a beautifully wrapped gift. 

The You're Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile singer appeared to be shunning her own advice, as her expression was entirely concealed behind the mask. 
   
Party pooper: The 39-year-old was the lady of the hour as she attended the Miu Miu Women's Tales Dinner with her husband Erik Anders Lang 

Sia's attempt to go incognito had quite the opposite effect as onlookers were instantly drawn to her unusual ensemble.  

Arriving at the event with her doting American film maker husband Erik Anders Lang, Sia wore a bright orange and red horizontal stripe dress that could have easily passed as wrapping paper. 

Rolling her sleeves up to reveal her tattooed arms, the Australian singer paired the look with a matching pair of red strappy high heels. 
   
Sia, is that you? The Chandeleir hit maker wore a bright orange and red horizontal stripe dress as she posed for photographs with Erik and American actress Whitney Cummings 

Apart from her forearms, the only skin the star dared to bare were her legs from the knee down, as she revealed a glimpse of her sun kissed complexion. 

Meanwhile, her handsome beau had no trouble flashing his smile, as he dressed in a smart black suit and blue shirt and tie combination. 

Despite being camera shy, the performer posed for the obligatory red carpet photos alongside her beau and American actress Whitney Cummings.   
   
Wiggin' out! Earlier in the day, Sia stuck to a familiar script as she covered her face underneath the same wig as she attended a photocall for short film series Women's Tales at the film festival 

The Whitney star wore a black leather mini dress and matching heels which featured a fur pouf as her porcelain complexion were covered with a sheer makeup look and red lip. 

Other celebrities in attendance at the dinner included Dakota Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld and Julia Garner. 

Earlier in the day, Sia stuck to a familiar script as she covered her face underneath the same wig as she attended a photo call for short film series Women's Tales. 
   
Can't Sia! The singer paired the wig with a jaunty black hat which matched her leather look jacket 

This time however the singer paired the wig with a jaunty black hat which matched her leather look jacket and tight fitted pants. 

Sia sported a pair of black strappy heels and clutched a black chained bag. 

While not showing her face the shy star, who is originally from Adelaide, had a fresh white manicure and pedicure. 
   
Cover up: Sia also sported a pair of black strappy heels and clutched a black chained bag 

On Tuesday, the US-based starlet left Los Angeles for Europe with Erik. 

To make her way through the airport terminal, Sia covered her face once again in a multicoloured scarf. 

She was more dressed down, wearing a long denim jacket and light blue pants and shirt underneath. 

With her husband and her entourage in tow, including security guards escorted the award-winner through the terminal. 
   
Shying away: On Tuesday, the US-based starlet left Los Angeles for Europe and covered her face once again in a multicoloured scarf 

Sia, whose real name is Sia Kate Isobelle Furler, is known for hits including Elastic Heart and Big Girls Cry. 

She just missed out on a Moonman at this week's MTV VMA Awards where she was nominated for Elastic Heart's clip, for Best Female Video. 

Earlier this year, when asked by Sunrise co-host Samantha Armytage why she still shuns the spotlight and chooses to wear a wig in public, Sia's response was simple: 'Because it's ugly, it makes me feel hunted. 

'You feel like prey and they're the predator and you're being hunted ... You go into fight or flight.' 

Describing celebrity attention as 'unpleasant', the notoriously reluctant star said she only ever wanted a 'regular life' while doing what she loves - making music. 

'It's just like wanting to have a regular life just like a regular person and still be able to make music and sing ... but without having to sacrifice just having a regular life, that's all.' 
   
No luck: Earlier in the week the Australian singer was defeated by Taylor Swift for the MTV VMA Award in the Best Female Video category

A48,"Devo Co-Founder Serves Guests 9/11-Themed Wedding Cake, Box Cutters by Jen Chung in News	on Sep 14, 2015 12:10 pm Via TMZ.com Devo co-founder Jerry Casale got married last week on September 11th, and for some reason the happy couple decided it was a fantastic idea to make the deadliest terrorist attack in American history their wedding theme. Festive! We're guessing they registered for this 9/11 cheese plate too. Someone sent TMZ photos and details about Casale and Krista Napp's event:Jerry Casale -- Devo's singer and bassist -- married Krista Napp on Friday at Michael's Restaurant in Santa Monica. Of course, Friday marked the 14th anniversary of the September 11th attacks ... a fact the bride and groom made sure their guests would never forget.
Fact 1: Their cake was the World Trade Center, with their images on top of each tower.
Fact 2: Guests got real box cutters as party favors.
Fact 3: Their table setting cards had an image of a ""Gerald & Krista"" engraved box cutter.

Via TMZ TMZ adds, ""it seems outrageous and offensive to make the murder of 2,977 people the centerpiece of your wedding -- we're told Jerry and Krista's friends weren't the least bit fazed because they both have a dark and strange sense of humor. As one guest put it ... Jerry has 'real heart as an artist, and is a super sweet guy.'"" Guess Casale couldn't book the Lumberton High School cheerleaders. Oh, well, next marriage!"

 Finally, the Duggars have something to smile about. 
Amy Duggar , niece of 19 Kids and Counting stars Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar , said 'I do' on Sunday evening, marrying her fiancé of less than two months, Dillon King . 

""This is such a positive moment in our lives,"" Amy tells PEOPLE of the happy occasion. Despite her family being embroiled in a second scandal – following his molestation revelations in May, her cousin Josh admitted to infidelity and pornography addiction and is currently seeking treatment at a faith-based rehab center – Amy was fêted by most of the Duggar clan, who turned out for her big ay.

The country-chic wedding took place on the grounds of Horton Farms near Bentonville, Arkansas. ""We're thinking there will be about 400 people,"" Amy told PEOPLE ahead of the day – a small gathering by Duggar standards . Says Amy, ""These are only our closest friends and family and their families"" 

The hundreds of guests included Jim Bob and Michelle, her cousin Jessa and even Josh's embattled wife Anna . ""She's been through so much,"" says Amy, who enlisted Anna and Josh's 5-year-old daughter Mackynzie as one of her flower girls, along with her young Duggar cousins Johanna, Jordyn, Jennifer and Josie. Her cousin Jill also made a stop at the wedding with her family, taking a break from the family's mission work in El Salvador. 

The color theme was rose gold and candlelight and the bride wore a sweetheart neckline gown designed by Essense of Australia.  

Though she was happy to tie the knot surrounded by her loved ones, she's also looking forward to moving on with her life. ""I can't wait to change my name"", she told PEOPLE earlier in the week. ""It's going to be a great day when Dillon signs that marriage license and my last name changes.""

A51,"A British father who feared his baby had been swapped at birth and sold to human traffickers in El Salvador has reportedly been reunited with his son after authorities tracked down the child by ordering other new mothers have their babies DNA tested. 
 
		 
Richard Cushworth, 41, originally from Bradford, West Yorkshire,  and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes Casanellas had suspected that a doctor at the hospital where she gave birth exchanged their child for another as she slept. 
  It is feared the youngster was switched at birth   
After attending a special court hearing before a judge yesterday the couple were told that their biological baby had been identified before the swapped babies were handed back to their respective families, according to news website  Elsalvador.com. 

			 
Attorney general Luis Martinez told reporters: ""We have returned the babies to their legitimate parents.  We hope that this has not happened on other occasions."" 



 
Mr Martinez said that a review of private and public hospitals' protocols would take place. 

The couple's doctor, Alejandro Guidos, was arrested over the matter but had protested his innocence after being bailed. 

Prosecutor Dinora Siguenza reportedly alleged yesterday that Dr Guidos was responsible for not following correct procedures and is still being investigated. 

The couple left the Gynaecological Hospital Centre in the country's capital San Salvador with the newborn but made a public appeal on local TV three months on, after a DNA test revealed the boy was unlikely to be their biological son. 

			 
Ms Casanellas, 39, initially became suspicious when she noticed the features of her newborn differed from those of the boy doctors handed her the day after she gave birth by emergency Caesarean in May. In particular, she thought the second baby had darker skin. 

She took the child to the couple's home in Dallas, Texas, but the pair, both missionaries working in El Salvador, returned to the Central American country after family members also expressed doubts. 

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We are in regular contact with the Cushworth family to provide support. 

""A full investigation has been launched by local police and we will provide all the assistance that we can.""

A52,"Over the past several years, incidents involving fake gold (usually in the form of gold-plated tungsten) have emerged every so often, usually involving Manhattan’s jewelry district, some of Europe’s bigger gold foundries, or the occasional billion dealer. But never was fake gold actually discovered in the form monetary gold, held by a bank as reserve capital and designed to fool bank regulators of a bank’s true financial state. This changed on Friday when Russia’s “Admiralty” Bank, which had its banking license revoked last week by Russia’s central bank, was reportedly using gold-plated metal as part of its “gold reserves.“ According to Russia’s Banki.ru, as part of a probe in the Admiralty bank, the central bank regulator questioned the existence of the bank’s reported quantity of precious metals held in reserve. Citing a source, Banki.ru notes that as part of its probe, instead of gold, the “regulator found gold-plated metal.” The Russian website further adds that according to “Admiralty” bank’s financial statements, as of August 1 the bank had declared as part of its highly liquid assets precious metals amounting to 400 million roubles. The last regulatory probe of the bank was concluded in the second half of August, said one of the Banki.ru sources. Another source claims that as part of the probe, the auditor questioned the actual availability of the bank’s precious metals and found gold-painted metal. The website notes that shortly before the bank’s license was revoked, the bank had offered its corporate clients to withdraw funds after paying a commission of 30%. This is shortly before Russia’s central bank disabled Admiralty’s eletronic payment systems on September 7.Admiralty Bank was a relatively small, ranked in 289th place among Russian banks in terms of assets. On August 1 the bank’s total assets were just above 8 billion roubles, while the monthly turnover was in the order of 40-55 billion rubles. The balance of the bank’s assets was poorly diversified: two-thirds of the bank’s assets (4.9 billion rubles) were invested in loans. The rest of the assets, about 30%, were invested in highly liquid assets. Or at least highly liquid on paper: according to Banki.ru the key reason for the bank’s license revocation was the central bank’s insistence that the bank had insufficient reserves against possible loan losses. The Russian central bank has not yet made an official statement. The first question, obviously, is if a small-to-mid level Russian bank was using gold-plated metal to fool the central bank about the quality of its “gold-backed” reserves, how many other Russian banks are engaged in comparable fraud. The second question, and perhaps more relevant, is how many global banks – especially among emerging markets, where gold reserves remain a prevalent form of physical reserve accumulation – are engaging in comparable fraud. Finally, what does this mean for gold itself, whose price on one hand is sliding with every passing day (thanks in part to what is now a record 228 ounces of paper claims on every ounce of physical gold as reported before), even as it increasingly appears there is a major global physical shortage. If the Admiralty bank’s fraud is found to be pervasive, what will happen to physical gold demand as more banks are forced to buy the yellow metal in the open market to avoid being shuttered and/or prison time for the executives?

A54,"Facebook has a lot to answer for but the recent post highlighting free Calpol on the NHS served a useful purpose.  
 

	  
 

	Responsible comment served to educate the public that isn’t a national scheme (unless you live in Scotland) and that there is huge variability in what is available, depending upon where you happen to live. Indeed, NHS Choices made changes to its website to explain the situation.  


	  
 

	A bewildered public would be right in thinking that this was no way to run a health service.  
 

	  
 

	The English Pharmacy Board has been running a campaign on how pharmacists can relieve some of the pressures on urgent and emergency care. We have highlighted the benefits of pharmacists working in A and E departments and secured a trial, the results of which are due soon. We have also been pressing for the adoption of a national Minor Ailments Scheme.  
 

	  
 

	The RPS is now represented on a number of groups working with the NHS England Urgent and Emergency Care Review Team. We have consistently pressed the case for a national minor ailments service and have stressed that no training resource is required because dealing with common ailments is something community pharmacists do on a daily basis. We have also engaged with people who will be reviewing the national pharmacy contract and made similar representations.  
 

	  
 

	The reality is that senior civil servants are, to some extent, at the beck and call of their political masters. The current buzz word on Politics Street is localism. Hence, there is a desire for local commissioners to have more say over which services are commissioned locally.  
 

	  
 

	As pharmacists we all recognise that consistency would make sense. At the moment it is hard to predict which way this service will go, so the EPB continues to press for a national scheme. If localism wins the day then we have also been saying that there needs to be more consistency in how the service is delivered nationally.  
 

	  
 

	You can help. If you are interested in lobbying your local MP then get in touch, join our list of Politicos and take advantage of some practical RPS support. Find out more about the campaign and how to get involved at www.rpharms.com/urgentcare.  
 

	  
 

	The urgent care campaign is just one of many ways in which the RPS represents and raises the profile of the profession, but we could not do this without the support of our members. To find out more about RPS membership visit www.rpharms.com/membership.

A56,"Vice President Joe Biden told a crowd at an Atlanta synagogue last week he was still evaluating his family's emotional readiness for a third presidential run -- and that ""there's no way to put a timetable on that."" 
 
But ready or not, key dates loom for Biden if he hopes to wrest support from current Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and have a chance at securing his party's nomination. 

Originally, Biden said he would announce his intentions by the end of the summer: months later than other Democrats running for president, but well ahead of the campaign trail mileposts that will begin appearing this fall. 

His associates now say the end-of-summer deadline is likely to slip by without an announcement as the vice president continues to wrestle with the late-May death of his eldest son, Beau. 

The official end of summer -- Sept. 23 -- also falls on a busy week for the White House, with visits from Pope Francis and Chinese President Xi Jinping both on the schedule. As a key foreign policy hand, and the highest-ranking Catholic in the U.S. government, Biden is expected to play a role in both events -- and is unlikely to overshadow them with a campaign decision. 

Instead, a decision by Oct. 1 is more likely, according to people familiar with the vice president's decision-making. But even that date could slide as the vice president and his family continue to assess their ""emotional energy"" for what would undoubtedly be a grueling campaign. 

The unpredictable nature of this year's race -- illustrated by the surge in support for outside candidates like Sanders and Donald Trump -- has led some Biden advisers to believe a late entry wouldn't be as detrimental as conventional wisdom might suggest. 

""As time goes on there appears to be a bigger and bigger space in the Democratic primary for him to step into,"" said one Biden adviser, speaking anonymously to describe the thinking within Biden's circle. 

The first Democratic primary debate, a CNN-sponsored forum in Nevada, falls on Oct. 13 -- an important venue for Biden to introduce himself as a presidential contender to a national audience. 

But while considered unlikely, even that could slip by without a decision from the vice president. The Democratic Party has committed to three other debates before the first ballots are even cast in the nominating contest, leaving Biden later opportunities to square off with rivals before voters must make a choice. 

On Oct. 22, Clinton is set to testify before the Select Committee on Benghazi on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are expected to pepper the former secretary of state about her role in the 2012 attack in Libya, as well as her use of a private email while acting as the nation's top diplomat. 

While Biden's political advisers insist his decision will have little to do with Clinton's performance as a candidate -- and instead on his own capacity for a run -- a shaky performance during her testimony would only ramp up Democratic jitters about her candidacy. 

There are hard-and-fast filing deadlines that Biden must abide by in order to appear on the ballot in key early voting states, though in some cases they have yet to be firmly established. In New Hampshire, the deadline to file for the first-in-the-nation primary typically falls toward the end of October, though the date this year hasn't been announced. 

In South Carolina, where Biden's supporters say he has the best chance of slowing any momentum by Clinton or Sanders, Biden would need to file his candidacy by early December. 

An analysis by the Brookings Institution found the number of potential delegates forfeited by waiting to declare until after December was substantial: if Biden missed filing deadlines through the end of December, he wouldn't be eligible for more than 1,500 potential delegates -- more than half of the 2,232 necessary to clinch the Democratic nomination. 

In reality, Democratic operatives say Biden doesn't have until the filing deadlines to make a decision, noting the time required to build a campaign infrastructure and raise the millions needed to operate a feasible bid. 

""It's awfully late. You talk to people in Iowa, it seems early, but it's awfully late to begin the kind of organization it takes to win the Iowa caucuses,"" said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and a CNN senior political commentator.

A57,"RISHON LEZION, Israel, Sept. 8, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B.O.S. Better Online Solutions Ltd. (the ""Company"", ""BOS"") ( Nasdaq:BOSC ), a leading Israeli provider of RFID and Supply Chain solutions to global enterprises, announced today that its RFID and Mobile division, operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, BOS-Dimex Ltd. (""Dimex"") has signed a Letter of Intent for the acquisition of the business operations of iDnext Ltd. (""iDnext"") and its subsidiary Next-Line Ltd. (""Next-Line""). The parties expect to consummate the transaction in January 2016. 

iDnext, incorporated in 1997, is an Israeli private company that specializes in Automatic Identification and Data Capture (""AIDC"") through barcode and RFID technology, mainly for libraries. 
   
Next-Line, incorporated in 2008, specializes in providing on-site inventory count services, mainly to leading retail chains in Israel in the fields of apparel, food, convenience and pharma. Next-Line also provides asset tagging and counting services for corporate and governmental entities, on the basis of its experienced team and proprietary software. Next-Line is able to quickly and accurately count inventory, with minimum shutdown time, as compared to manual inventory counts typically performed by a company's employees. 

Yuval Viner, CEO of BOS said: ""I am pleased to announce the acquisition of the business of iDnext and Next-Line. The Next-Line inventory counting service is complementary to our existing line of products and services. Following this acquisition, our RFID and Mobile division will be able to offer customers a one-stop-shop inventory management solution. The solution will include a Warehouse Management System and varied technologies and equipment for automatic identification of inventory and assets. This acquisition promotes our long term strategy, to grow and strengthen BOS' through acquisitions."" 

Moti Harel, founder and CEO of iDnext and Next-Line stated: ""I am excited to join BOS' RFID and Mobile division, which I have known for many years. We have recently cooperated with BOS in a couple of projects and I am confident that BOS is the right platform to support the market's growing demand for inventory and assets counting services."" 

Eran Harel, CTO of iDnext and Next-Line said: ""In 2014, we have launched new proprietary software, designed to improve the control and efficiency of the counting process. The combination of this platform with BOS' capabilities is expected to deliver substantial value to customers."" 

Eyal Cohen, CFO of BOS, stated: ""In view of the reduction of BOS' loans, net of cash and deposits, from $14.9 million in December 2009 to $2.7 million in June 2015, BOS now has a capital structure that allows it to make acquisitions to facilitate the growth of our company. We anticipate that the acquisition of iDnext and Next-Line will positively impact our profits, commencing year 2016. In 2014, iDnext and Next-Line generated revenues (unaudited) of $1.5 million and an operating profit (unaudited) of $250,000."" 

Dimex intends to acquire the business operation of iDnext and Next-Line in consideration for cash and BOS ordinary shares. The consideration will include an initial payment comprised of NIS 1.6 million (approximately $410,000) paid in cash and NIS 1.3 million (approximately $330,000) paid by the issuance of BOS ordinary shares. 

Dimex shall make additional performance payments based on the operational profit of the acquired business in the calendar years 2016 and 2017. For each of 2016 and 2017, Dimex shall pay the sellers an amount equal to the operational profit in such year multiply by two, less NIS 1.45 million.  In case the annual operational profit will be greater than NIS 1,250,000 (approximately $320,000) Dimex shall further pay up to NIS 150,000 (approximately $38,000) as a success payment. These performance based payments shall be made in May of 2017 and of 2018. Dimex may elect to make up to 35% of the performance based payments in BOS shares. 

Closing of the transaction is subject to execution of a definitive agreement and the meeting of certain closing conditions, including satisfactory completion of due diligence and approval of BOS' bank.

A58,"Few global summits can compete with the opening of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). All the world’s a stage, but the spotlight shines brightest each September in Manhattan, as global leaders gather for UN’s “back to school” night. But while most attention will focus on speeches from the green marble podium, the real action will occur offstage. This year’s most important side event is a special Monday afternoon session on UN peacekeeping , convened by President Barack Obama himself and involving leaders of fifty countries. Its outcome will help determine whether the United Nations gets serious about updating the most important weapon in its arsenal to the realities of the twenty-first century. 
 
Surprisingly, “peacekeeping” wasn’t even mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945. The concept was invented to describe so-called “Chapter 6 ½” operations falling between pacific settlement of disputes (under Chapter 6) and coercive enforcement action (under Chapter 7). By now, peacekeeping is the UN’s bread and butter. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO) commands the world’s largest globally deployed military force—more than 105,000 “blue helmets” and another 15,000 police and civilians, scattered across sixteen operations . These complex and multidimensional missions bear scant resemblance to the UN’s early peacekeeping forays, which tended to involve the insertion of lightly armed observers between parties who had already laid down their weapons. Today’s peacekeepers often find themselves drawn into combat with, and outgunned by, heavily armed groups, even as they try to protect civilian populations from slaughter. 
 
Unfortunately, UN peacekeeping is in deep crisis . The heavy demand for missions is outstripping the UN’s capacity to mobilize adequate funding, troops, equipment, and logistical support. Individual operations are repeatedly undermined by unrealistic UN Security Council mandates, unclear rules of engagement, weak mission leadership, and unprofessional—even criminal—conduct by UN troops themselves. The shortcomings have been on display in flailing UN operations from South Sudan to Mali to the Central African Republic. 
 
The president’s message on Monday afternoon will be clear: these gaps can and must be closed. Strengthening UN peacekeeping is no humanitarian act of charity, no mere expression of global “ social work .” It is of fundamental importance to U.S. and international security. This is particularly true when it comes to the “arc of instability” that now spans west and central Africa, the Sahel, the Horn, the Middle East, and southwest Asia. Across this broad expanse, states are failing, humans are suffering, conflict is erupting, and extremists are plotting, generating regional instability, aiding criminals and terrorists, and even facilitating diseases like Ebola . And increasingly, peacekeeping is the instrument of choice for addressing these threats. 
 
President Obama’s commitment to UN peacekeeping runs deep. Six years ago at his first UN peacekeeping summit, he convened a meeting of major troop contributing countries (TCCs) like Rwanda and Bangladesh, the unsung heroes who place their own soldiers on the line in peacekeeping missions. Last year he asked Vice President Biden to convene a similar meeting . This year, the president has asked each of his fifty counterparts to show up with specific national pledges to improve UN peacekeeping, including offers to contribute more soldiers, increase funding levels, provide airlift and other logistics, or help train peacekeepers. As an initial down payment, Secretary of State Kerry and his Indian counterpart on September 22 announced a joint initiative to train troops in six African nations, as part of the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership launched at last year’s U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.  On Monday, the president plans to announce a far more comprehensive package of U.S. commitments. 
 
Still, the president will stress that the shared threats cry out for burden-sharing among UN member states. The summit’s success will depend not just on the individual contributions countries bring to the table, but on their collective commitment to structural reforms. To equip peacekeepers with the tools and training required to fulfill their mandates, the peacekeeping summit should begin by implementing the needed reforms identified by the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations (HIPPO), which delivered its report to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in June. Top reform priorities include: persuading more nations to become troop contributing countries; increasing the number of troops that current TCCs provide; improving pre-deployment training of national contingents; ensuring that UN Security Council mandates are clear and realistic, particularly when it comes to protecting civilians; specifying rules of engagement that are aligned with the conflict situation; providing peacekeepers with high-end military capabilities to defend themselves and thwart “spoilers”; adapting peacekeeping doctrine to counterinsurgency and counterterrorist threats; and holding TCCs accountable both for their performance in the field and any misconduct—particularly when it comes to crimes of sexual violence .

A60,"Science makes it clear that the laissez-faire alternative is a climate-addled future of mega-storms, drought, water wars and mass migration 
Negotiators from 195 nations tasked with crafting a universal climate pact are driven by twin fears tugging in opposite directions, which may result in a hollow deal, say analysts. 
  
The all-too-real prospect of climate catastrophe on a horizon of decades, not centuries, coupled with a rising tide of expectations, would seem to be powerful incentives to forge an agreement that is truly up to the task. 
 
Science makes it clear that the laissez-faire alternative is a climate-addled future of mega-storms, drought, water wars and mass migration. 
 
It is also a reminder that the window of opportunity for acting is barely ajar—if human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases don't peak very soon and drop very swiftly, it may soon slam shut.
 
At the same time, however, career diplomats—and their political bosses—working on the nitty-gritty of the deal to be inked in Paris in December are haunted by another fear subtly nudging them in the opposite direction: the fear of failur. 
 
""Our concern is that we will end up with a lowest common denominator, where everybody just agrees on the least ambitious options,"" said Li Shuo of Greenpeace China. 
 
The last time the world tried to craft a ""last chance"" universal climate pact —in Copenhagen, in 2009—it ended in tears, with more than 110 unhappy heads of state scrambling in overtime to piece together a three-page, face-saving ""declaration"" instea. 
 
""Not repeating the mistakes of Copenhagen"" is a common refrain at the talks in Bonn, and something of a mantra for the organisers of the November 30-December 11 conference in the French capital. 
 
And yet, progress has been incremental and painfully slow. 
 
Negotiators left the former East German capital Friday after a week of closed-door meetings with very little to show and a draft agreement ""not fit for a negotiation,"" in the words of the European Commission's top negotiator, Elina Bardram. 
     Exlanation f how permafrost thawing could radically accelerate global warming 
Getting ministers involved 
 
But it is unfair, analysts say, to place too much blame on rank-and-file diplomats, themselves deeply frustrated to have made so little headway with only five negotiating days left before the main event in Paris. 
  
Without clear instructions from their ministers and, at the top of the political food chain, state leaders, they can only go so far in removing the logjams that have beleaguered climate talks for years. 
 
""You have a very tight brief coming here from your ministers and capitals that you can't go beyond,"" said Alden Meyer, a veteran climate analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
 
""That kind of dynamic can impede creativity and the ability to break through boxes to interesting solutions."" 
 
The French hosts have moved aggressively to bridge that gap. 
 
To start, they have enlisted early and often the ministers who will ink the deal in December, with the next ""informal"" meeting—with some 60 countries in attendance—scheduled for this Sunday and Monda. 
 
Other high-level parlays coming up will give top leaders a chance to narrow the gap on core climate issues, ranging from hundreds of billions of dollars in financing for poor countries to how ambitious the world will be in slashing greenhouse gases. 
 
On September 27, French President Francois Hollande and Ban Ki-moon will host a climate luncheon summit in New York, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. 
   Diplomats have lamented the ""snail's pace"" of a round of crunch UN talks in Bonn to forge a workable draft for a climate rescue pact to be inked by the year's end 
A game changer 
 
Also in September, foreign ministers will gather in another climate arena, called the Major Economies Forum, with finance ministers set to meet in Lima the following month at a joint session of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 
 
Finally, France has invited presidents and prime ministers to attend the first day of the 12-day Paris conference. 
 
""It is a way of ensuring that they inject some political momentum at the beginning,"" said Meyer. 
   World map assessing international commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
""What happened in Copenhagen is that you had the ministers unable to do their job because they knew the leaders were coming at the end."" 
 
Bardram is optimistic that in Paris, negotiators will not paper over differences and punt serious disagreements further down the road. 
 
""A purely superficial political accord without a robust set of accompanying [operational] decisions is not sufficient—I know that there are many parties that share that vision,"" she told AFP.
 
""This is not only about action for a few, but about transition to low carbon. It will be a game changer.""

									President Xi Visits U.S.   Full coverage:  China’s Leader    
BEIJING, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- The fight against corruption never ends and the zero tolerance to corruption will never change, Chinese president Xi Jinping said in a written interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday. 
 
""Cracking down on corruption is what all countries must do and what their peoples wish to see. The ultimate purpose of the Chinese Communist Party is to serve the people wholeheartedly,"" Xi said in the interview ahead of his U.S. visit. 
 
He left Beijing Tuesday afternoon for the state visit at the invitation of U.S. President Barack Obama. 
 
""Our Party owes its governing status to the support of the people, so we must maintain its flesh-and-blood ties with the people,"" Xi said. 
 
The Party does not operate in a vacuum, so it has unavoidably found itself with problems of one kind or another, Xi said, adding that corruption is just such a persistent one. 
 
The Party must be courageous enough to face up to the problem and go out to correct it through self-purification and self-rectification, Xi said. 
 
""Our people hate corruption more than anything else and we must act to allay their concerns. Therefore, we decided to go after both 'tigers and flies', wrongdoers regardless of their ranks."" 
 
Since the 18th Party Congress, China has intensified anti-corruption efforts, dealt with a large number of corrupt officials in accordance with law, including some who used to hold very high offices, and won extensive support and thumbs-up from the Chinese people. 
 
""On institutional building in this respect, let me share with you two remarks I made. The first is that we must keep power in the cage of systemic checks. The other one is, transparency is the best precaution against corruption,"" Xi said. 
 
As we go further in anti-corruption campaign, we will focus more on institutional building so that officials will not dare and cannot afford to be corrupt and, more importantly, have no desire to take that course, Xi said. 
 
Right now, we are formulating and updating relevant laws and regulations to truly put power inside a more closely-knit cage of effective checks, the president said. 
 
With respect to asset disclosure by officials, China adopted relevant regulations back in 2010 to require such reporting which was subject to random check and verification every year. 
 
Xi said the proportion of verified reporting has increased steadily, and no one would take exception. Should anyone be found to be dishonest, they will be punished accordingly. 
 
""I once said that the fight against corruption never ends. Our zero tolerance to corruption will never change. Nor will our determination, courage and severity with which we punish it in order to rid the Party of corruption."" 
 
All acts of corruption must be dealt with, Xi said.

A63,"Senator: Use military might to resolve conflicts, not make them 
Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate on Wednesday to outline his support of the Obama administration's Iran nuclear deal, likening its critics to those who backed the Iraq War in 2002. 

In doing so, Sanders drew a sharp contrast with Hillary Clinton, who earlier Wednesday made her own case for supporting the deal. 

""Those who have spoken out against the Iran agreement, including many in this chamber, and those who have made every effort to thwart the diplomatic process, are many of the same people who spoke out forcefully and irresponsibly about the need to go to war with Iraq, one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of our country,"" Sanders said. 

Sanders did not mention his vote against the war in 2002, but he has frequently cited his early opposition to the bill that authorized military force, and, like other Democratic candidates, has used the issue to highlight differences between him and Clinton. 

In the speech, Sanders characterized the GOP as war-mongering. 

""I fear that many of my Republican colleagues don't fully understand that war must be a last resort, not the first resort. It is easy to go to war. It is not so easy to fully comprehend the unintended consequences of that war,"" Sanders said. ""Yes, the military option should always be on the table, but it should be the last option."" 

Sanders' remarks came hours after Clinton delivered a forceful yet cautious backing of the Iran nuclear deal in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, saying it helps protect Israel and pledging that, if elected, she would strengthen the security bond between the Jewish state and the U.S. 

The Senate is currently debating a resolution to disapprove of the administration's agreement. Forty-two Democratic members of the Senate have come out in favor of the deal, giving President Barack Obama enough votes to prevent a likely GOP-led resolution disapproving of the deal. 

""It is my firm belief that the test of a great nation with the most powerful military on earth is not how many wars it can engage in, but how it can use our strength and our capabilities to resolve international conflicts in a peaceful way,"" Sanders said. ""I believe it is incumbent upon us to give the negotiated agreement the chance to succeed."" 

Clinton's vote to authorize the war in Iraq has nagged her political career for years, most notably during her 2008 bid for president, when then-Sen. Barack Obama, who publicly opposed the war, cited Clinton's support to claim he was better suited to lead on foreign policy.

A64,"Lawyers for a firebrand preacher who branded Islam ""satanic"" and ""heathen"" hopes to have his prosecution thrown out of court. 
 
		 
A defence solicitor for Pastor James McConnell said they were still awaiting disclosure of key documents, including a police officer's notebook. 
  Firebrand preacher Pastor James McConnell appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court after being charged over a controversial sermon   
Joe Rice told Belfast Magistrates' Court: ""We have not lost sight of a possible abuse of process application. 

			 
""We are still awaiting notebook entries from Constable Stewart."" 



 
Seventy-eight-year-old Pastor McConnell, from Shore Road, Newtownabbey, Co Antrim, is charged in connection with a controversial sermon he made last May. 

He is being prosecuted under the 2003 Communications Act and faces two charges - improper use of a public electronic communications network and causing a grossly offensive message to be sent by means of a public electronic communications network -  after remarks made from the pulpit of his Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle in north Belfast were streamed online. 

Hundreds of Christian supporters attended the Laganside Court Complex in Belfast City Centre for the brief hearing which had to be accommodated in one of the largest court rooms. 

Solicitor Paul Dougan revealed that the defence team was wading through volumes of material from volunteers who had sprung to the pastor's defence. 

			 
He said: ""The case will be contested. 

""We have been inundated with scores of potential witnesses who wish to give evidence on behalf of Pastor McConnell."" 

Material broadcast on the radio and television is also being sought by the defence team. 

Mr Dougan added: ""We have corresponded with the BBC's legal team on that."" 

			 
District Judge George Conner was told, if it proceeds, the case could last up to five days. 

Granting a request for a four-week adjournment to allow the Public Prosecution to review the case, the judge said: "" I would be keen to get this case moved on as soon as possible."" 

Pastor McConnell who was dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and purple tie, did not enter the dock. 

Instead, he sat in the public gallery beside his wife Margaret, supported by friends and other family members. 

Afterwards, amid cheers, applause and hymn singing he told supporters who had filled the court corridor: ""I believe, for the prosecution, this is a hot potato. 

			 
""They don't know how to handle it. 

""They are miserable. 

""I am looking forward to testifying if they give me a chance. 

""Either they try me and put me in prison or I am free to preach the gospel."" 

As Pastor McConnell left the building they sang Onward Christian Soldiers. 

North Belfast DUP MP Nigel Dodds stood at the back of the court throughout proceedings. 

Outside, hundreds of supporters were joined by the DUP's East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson and North Belfast MLA William Humphrey. 

The large crowd, some of whom were carrying banners and placards which read We support Pastor McConnell and Evil Sharia law is not welcome in our country, cheered and sang hymns. 

After embracing and shaking hands with his supporters, Pastor McConnell said: ""I will stand firm for the gospel. I will not relent one inch."" 

He also said he had been heartened by the level of support. 

""This is important, not only for me, it is important for every minister of the gospel of every denomination of freedom of speech and freedom of worship. 

""This is, I believe, a test case."" 

The case has been adjourned until October 1.

A65,"Research Analysts’ updated eps estimates for Monday, September 21st: 
 
AAC Holdings (NYSE:AAC) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at William Blair. The analysts wrote, “Universal Health Services Acquires Foundations Recovery Network; Demonstrates Continued Interest in the Substance Abuse Space On Friday, September 18, 2015, Universal Health Services (UHS $137.93) announced its intention to acquire Foundations Recovery Network (Foundations) in a deal valued at roughly $350 million. This follows the late-2014 purchase of CRC Health by Acadia Healthcare (ACHC $75.84) and highlights the continued interest in the substance abuse treatment space by the industry’s largest behavioral healthcare providers (which we believe shows the positive macro trends in the industry). Foundations was founded by American Addiction Centers (AAC) CEO Michael Cartwright, and we therefore believe the organization provides similar services, targets a somewhat similar customer base (via direct-to-consumer marketing platforms and a national sales team), and has a relatively similar sales mix as AAC.”” 
 
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) had its hold rating reissued by analysts at S&P Equity Research. S&P Equity Research currently has a $82.00 target price on the stock. 
 
National Securities initiated coverage on shares of StoneCastle Financial Corp (NASDAQ:BANX) . The firm issued a neutral rating and a $19.00 target price on the stock. The analysts wrote, “We are initiating coverage of StoneCastle Financial Corporation (BANX) with a NEUTRAL rating and $19 price target.  BANX is unique for a number of reasons, the first being it is not a BDC per se but a registered investment company (RIC) which puts its asset coverage requirement at 300% as opposed to 200% for BDCs.  Also, StoneCastle invests primarily in investment grade companies (75% rated investment grade as of 2Q15) as opposed to BDCs which investment primarily in below investment grade companies.  The non-BDC status permits BANX to maintain its industry concentration of community and regional banks.  We believe that community banks are an attractive investment as regulation continues to drive M&A in the sector, banks continue to require capital, and StoneCastle’s deal flow pertaining to this sector remains robust.  The company has had no losses or impairments of assets since its inception.  StoneCastle is also seeking to invest in a pooled bank transaction which would be funded with non-recourse financing and permit higher leverage than what would otherwise be in the RIC structure itself.  We believe BANX is in a position to continue to improve effective yields and NIM (net investment margin).  We also think that BANX will continue to see sizable deal flow and should be relatively immune from the slowdown in traditional middle market originations.   Our $19 price target implies an estimated 2016 Price/Net Investment Income (P/ NII) of 10.7x, dividend yield of 6.9%, and Price/Net Asset Value (P/NAV) of 0.83x.  BANX does not really have a publicly traded comp set.  Although there are certainly other non-BDC RICs, there are none to our knowledge that invest exclusively in community banks.” 
 
Sky Plc (LON:BSY) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Goldman Sachs. 
 
ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a buy rating. The firm currently has $47.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, “In fiscal 2016, ConAgra aims to improve its profitability with the help of three major strategic initiatives; reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses; expansion of Lamb Weston as well as Consumer Foods business through capital investments and portfolio improvements; and balanced capital allocation. The company believes that its acquisition of Blake's All Natural Foods would serve to improve top-line results in the upcoming quarters by tapping the growing demand for frozen foods. Moreover, backed by lucrative dividend and share repurchase programs, ConAgra aims to augment the value of its shareholders. However, appreciation of the U.S. dollar, extensive industry rivalry as well as volatility in input supply might pose challenges before the company, going forward.” 
 
Commerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Commerce Bancshares’ second-quarter 2015 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Improvement in revenues and a reduction in provisions were partly offset by elevated costs. We believe that a robust capital base and sturdy liquidity level makes the company well positioned to capitalize on its penchant for inorganic growth. Also, the company’s initiatives in the mortgage banking area are expected to pay off in the form of enhanced fee generation going forward. Further, the company’s steady capital deployment activities continue to boost shareholders’ value. However, we remain apprehensive regarding the impact of weak expense management, stringent regulations and prevailing low interest rate environment on profitability in the near-term.” 
 
Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) had its market perform rating reissued by analysts at William Blair. 
 
Cidara Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CDTX) had its outperform rating reaffirmed by analysts at Wedbush. They currently have a $22.00 target price on the stock. 
 
Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Colgate-Palmolive commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories. We believe that Colgate-Palmolive’s continued focus on product innovation along with globally recognized brands and presence in both developed and emerging economies enables it to capture growth opportunities and boost profitability. Also, its capital allocation strategy enables it to constantly reward shareholders. However, the company reported dismal second-quarter 2015 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines declined year over year and lagged estimates due to the impact of adverse foreign currency fluctuations. Also, estimates moved lower as the company expects these currency headwinds and macroeconomic woes to linger in 2015 and in turn, hurt results.” 
 
Deckers Outdoor Corp (NASDAQ:DECK) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a buy rating. They currently have $68.00 target price on the stock. According to Zacks, “Deckers posted narrower-than-expected loss of $1.43 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. However, the loss widened from the year-ago period. On the other hand, net sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but rose 1.1% year over year on the back of strong performance of its Teva and HOKA ONE ONE brands, offset by softness witnessed across the UGG and Sanuk brands. Sales trends remained sturdy across the Direct-to-Consumer division, while Omni-Channel initiatives boosted consumer experience. Management now projects top- and bottom-line growth of 8% and 10.5%, respectively, for fiscal 2016.” 
 
DaVita HealthCare Partners (NYSE:DVA) had its outperform rating reaffirmed by analysts at William Blair. 
 
DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at William Blair. 
 
EMC (NYSE:EMC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “EMC Corp. reported mixed second quarter results with earnings surpassing the Zacks Concensus Estimate while revenue missed the same. We believe the modest performance was due to significant competition in storage, cloud computing and Big Data markets, which, along with the sluggish IT spending and pricing pressure, will continue to pressure the stock. Nevertheless, the company’s long-term growth remain supported by customer wins, strong backlog, high-end product launches and VMware. EMC’s strategic acquisitions, partnerships and product breadth focusing on the third generation IT platform (Big Data, predictive analytics and mobile computing) will help enterprises move to the cloud, thus driving its top line.” 
 
Randgold Resources (NASDAQ:GOLD) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Goldman Sachs. 
 
Huron Consulting Group (NASDAQ:HURN) had its outperform rating reiterated by analysts at William Blair. The analysts wrote, “Commentary About Large Project Creates Short-Term Headwind, but Still Like Stock for 2016 What Happened? Shares of Huron Consulting have traded down 7%-8% over the last three days following a presentation by management at a competitor’s conference.”” 
 
ICICI Bank (NYSE:IBN) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “ICICI Bank’s first-quarter fiscal 2016 (ended Jun 30) results primarily benefited from growth in revenues, partially offset by elevated operating expenses and higher loan loss provisions. We believe the company’s increased dependence on domestic loans, focus on improving fee income, a stable fund base and market leadership in the insurance business will keep enhancing growth. However, a highly competitive operating environment, mounting expenses, persistent deterioration in credit quality and stringent regulatory requirements will continue to dampen the company’s performance.” 
 
Infineon Technologies AG (OTCMKTS:IFNNY) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Infineon’s third-quarter fiscal 2015 results showed improvement both in term of revenues and earnings driven by strong seasonality in demand pattern. The company witnessed robust performance across all segments, coupled with considerable benefits from the International Rectifier acquisition, which drove earnings in the quarter. However, cyclical nature of the semi-conductor industry and prolonged time-cycle test for products will likely act as headwinds. Moreover, the company operates in a highly competitive environment. As a result, it might be forced to reduce prices or increase spending, both of which will impact sales and profits adversely. Also, frequent introduction of products and difficulty in integration of acquired companies may weigh on Infineon’s near-term results.” 
 
Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) had its strong-buy rating reaffirmed by analysts at S&P Equity Research. S&P Equity Research currently has a $64.00 target price on the stock. 
 
John Wiley & Sons (NASDAQ:JW.A) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “John Wiley & Sons reported first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of $0.58 per share that outdid expectations, while revenues of $423 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $429 million. However, on a constant currency basis, both metrics were up year over year driven by growth in Online Program Management, Online Test Preparation, Custom Material, and Author-Funded Access.  Given the gradual decline of print media, the company is transforming its business into a more digital services oriented one. Revenue from Print books declined 9% in quarter and market for the same is expected to remain under pressure. Moreover, due to its global operations, the company’s revenues are vulnerable to currency fluctuations.” 
 
Meredith (NYSE:MDP) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Favorable advertising trends in the digital section and recent acquisitions continue to favorably impact Meredith’s performance. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, wherein earnings of $0.94 per share grew 6.8% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the seventh straight quarter. Though revenues of $426 million came almost in line with the estimate, it grew 9% year over year. Waning print media trends and stiff competition continue to be immediate concerns. Nevertheless, Meredith is focused on bolstering advertising revenues, primarily in the digital space, and is increasingly concentrating on brand licensing, marketing services and e-Commerce. Recently, Media General has announced its decision to acquire Meredith.” 
 
Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Microsemi Corporation is an OEM of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits. Fiscal third-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Also, forward revenue guidance was encouraging. Microsemi’s compelling products, scope for margin expansion and decent balance sheet are other positives. However, pockets of weakness related to the high-margin satellite business, product transition at medical customers, push-out of some communications spending in China and a softer oil & gas market will impact revenues. Also, heavy investment in R&D could impact near-term profitability.” 
 
MGIC Investment Corp. (NYSE:MTG) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “MGIC Investment’s improving housing market, outstanding credit quality and new business will continue to spur growth in 2015. In 2015, the annual persistency is expected between 80% and 85%. However, lower annual premiums by the Federal Housing Administration, stricter capital regulations and persistently low interest rates are the headwinds.  Nonetheless, the company expects to comply with the revised PMIERs, which are likely to be effective by year-end 2015. With respect to earnings results, the company’s second-quarter net income per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and more than doubled year over year on a rise in new insurance written and lower loss. Increase in premiums and decrease in new delinquent notices, paid claims and a delinquent inventory resulted in the upside.” 
 
Nike (NYSE:NKE) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Nike posted splendid fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings and sales results along with enhanced margins. This encouraged management to issue a positive outlook for fiscal 2016, as it expects the strong momentum to continue. We remain impressed with Nike’s robust growth and product innovation that have helped it deliver positive earnings surprises for 12 straight quarters now. Further, the company aims to increase its global reach and market share by expanding its operations in the emerging markets while focusing on digital development, direct-to-consumer business and other brands. However, unfavorable currency fluctuations remain a matter of concern. Also, the company remains prone to the soft economic environment and risks of operating in overseas markets.” 
 
Ormonde Mining PLC (LON:ORM) was downgraded by analysts at TheStreet to a hold rating. 
 
PROSIEBENSAT.1 MEDIA (OTCMKTS:PBSFF) had its buy rating reiterated by analysts at Goldman Sachs. 
 
Petra Diamonds (NASDAQ:PDMDF) had its hold rating reiterated by analysts at Beaufort Securities. 
 
Petmed Express (NASDAQ:PETS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “PetMed exhibited a mixed performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. Incidentally, reorder sales growth in the quarter failed to fully offset the decline in new order sales. Meanwhile, increased product cost weighed on gross margin. However, we are encouraged that after a series of disappointing quarterly operating margin numbers, the company has been witnessing a turnaround in this regard in the last three quarters. This is mainly owing to the company’s ongoing cost reduction initiatives. On the flip side, however, lesser advertising raises concerns. The company is currently trying to implement several strategies to revive its top line including focus on advertising efficiency to improve new order sales.” 
 
Pier 1 Imports (NYSE:PIR) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Wedbush. The firm currently has a $9.50 price target on the stock. 
 
Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Pool Corp. has been negatively affected by seasonality, especially in the last reported quarter. Heavy rainfall and severe floods in Texas hurt demand in the region. Cooler weather in the Midwest and Northeast also delayed pool openings. Also, new pool construction remains well below the pre-recession levels, which is a concern. Further, currency headwinds weighed on international sales. However, the company’s base business sales growth, along with favorable trends in the housing market should make up for the headwinds to some extent. The continued strong growth in the pool renovation category along with reasonable sales growth in the green segment (the Horizon segment) is another positive.” 
 
Providence & Worcester Railroad Company (NYSE:PWX) had its buy rating reaffirmed by analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm currently has a $87.00 price target on the stock. 
 
Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) had its sector outperform rating reissued by analysts at Scotiabank. The firm currently has a $50.00 price target on the stock. 
 
Bankrate (NYSE:RATE) had its outperform rating reaffirmed by analysts at RBC Capital. They currently have a $15.00 price target on the stock. 
 
Relx PLC (NASDAQ:RELX) had its buy rating reaffirmed by analysts at Goldman Sachs. 
 
RTL Group (EBR:RTL) had its neutral rating reissued by analysts at Goldman Sachs. 
 
SEI Investments Company (NASDAQ:SEIC) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks from a sell rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “SEI Investments’ second-quarter 2015 earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Steady growth in revenues was offset by higher expenses. Further, the asset position continued to be robust. We believe that the company’s innovative and diverse global investment products and services will keep the earnings momentum alive going forward. Also, sturdy asset inflows will continue to support top-line growth. Though the company’s steady capital deployment activities remain impressive, we remain apprehensive regarding the impact of weak cost control, high dependence on fee-based revenues and a stringent regulatory landscape on profitability in the near term.” 
 
Sky Plc (NASDAQ:SKYAY) had its neutral rating reiterated by analysts at Goldman Sachs. 
 
Symrise Ag (OTCMKTS:SYIEF) had its buy rating reissued by analysts at DZ Bank AG.

Corporation reported impressive second-quarter 2015 results with both top and bottom lines faring better than expectations. Strong results were backed by solid performances at its business segments as well as lower tax rate. Also, the company raised its earnings outlook for 2015, anticipating a strong second half 2015. The company’s sustained focus on opportunistic acquisitions and expansion of global operations highlight its growth prospects. Moreover, its solid brand portfolio and opportunities with regard to distribution bode well. However, its significant global presence exposes it to currency headwinds.

A66,"It was August 1974 and U.S. president Richard Nixon — implicated in the Watergate coverup after a politically motivated break in — had just resigned in disgrce. 
 

                            ""I am not a crook!"" he pronounced defiantly, then reconsidered, flashed a peace sign and fled from office. 
 

                            Inspired by this real life political crisis — with its air of subterfuge and deceit — my siblings and I came to the paranoid conclusion that we could no longer trust each oter. 
 

                            ""I'm telling you, Mom, someone has been in my room!"" I would pronounce when I discovered a MAD magazine with a bent corner or record cover with a thumbprint. 
 

                            ""THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!"" 
 

                            ""How do you know anyone was in there?"" she would ask, annoyed by these thundering accusations from a 14-year old. 
 

                            I would slam my fist on the table for emphasis: ""Because I can see footprints in the shag carpet!'' 
 

                            This, generally, would end the conversation, as she retreated to another room while I continued to eye my four younger siblings through a lens of dark suspicion. 
 

                            And then my brother Arnold, 12 — determined to fight fire with fire — trotted off to Radio Shack for a do-it-yourself security system that set off an alarm bell every time an intruder tripped a hidden wre. 
 

                            The next time I snuck in to check out his Kiss records and ""Welcome Back Kotter"" action figures — BUSTE! 
 

                            Equally inspired, Glenn, 10, would place a glass of water on top of his door frame to drench unwanted visitors, while Trevor, eight, simply tacked a piece of cardboard with the crude warning ""KEEP OUT!"" in jagged letters on his door. 
 

                            Only Susan, a sweet trusting six-year-old, was in the dark, blithely unaware her four older brothers would sneak into her room to eat the powdered cake mix from her Easy Bake oven and help ourselves to whatever coins we found in her piggy bank. 
 

                            And so we lived, eyeing each other warily, snooping through each other's possessions while guarding our own like prison screws at Sing Sing. 
 

                            Confrontations, naturally, were inevitable. 
 

                            ""Why were you snooping in my room?' 
 

                            ""Who me?"" 
 

                            ""Yes, you. I hooked up my camera to the heat sensor on my science kit. Here's an infrared image of your hand on my hockey card collection. Please explain.'' 
 

                            When I look back today, I have to laugh, because the only thing any of us owned of any value was our prized, state-of-the-art stereo systems. 
 

                            Five kids, five stereos. It makes sense, right? 
 

                            This was 1974, after all — the golden age of shlock rock. Every kid needed their own stereo to play Grand Funk's ""Loco-Motion"" and Terry Jacks' ""Seasons in the Sun"" 
 

                            I should point out that, as a one income family with five kids, we weren't rich, feasting on tins of clammy Chef Boyardee ravioli while watching ""The Brady Bunch"" on our crappy 12-inch black and white. 
 

                            But lo and behold, there were those stereos — Technics turntables, Sanyo eight-tracks, JBL speakers the size of refrigerators — purchased with money from snow shovelling, grass cutting, paper routes and birthday gifts from anonymous great auts. 
 

                            ""That's the dumbest thing I ever heard,"" noted my wife when I recalled the deafening sound of five amplifiers turned to 11 under one roof. 
 

                            ""Who has five stereos in one house? Who cares if someone went in your room? Were you all insane?""' 
 

                            ""You don't understand,"" I fired back, glancing nervously over my shoulder. ""I was the oldest. I had the best stuff. Nothing was secure."" 
 

                            You would think we could joke about it today at family gatherings, having matured, mellowed, moved on with our lives. 
 

                            But when I recently asked my sibs to reflect back on our comical obsessions with secrecy and seclusion, the old paranoia returned. 
 

                            ""You want a piece of me?"" muttered Arnold, sounding like George Costanza's father on Seinfeld. ""YOU GOT IT!"" 
 

                            I have to admit, it's a rather odd family. 
 

                            While our peers were getting wasted at beer blasts and smoking dope in carpeted basements — or was that on ""That 70s Show?"" — we were at home, guarding our stereos with a stealth and determination more suited for careers as CIA operaties. 
 

                            There was, of course, an upside. 
 

                            This single-minded intensity devoted to in-home security not only kept us out of trouble, it was later put to good use earning university degrees and raising families who, I suspect, will one day guard their own bedrooms with the same unbridled zeal. 
 

                            ""Hey Max,"" I called the other day to my Pokemon obsessed seven-year-old. ""Want me to show you how to adjust your bedroom door so no one can sneak in and mess up your stuff?'' 
 

                            Max looks puzzled. 
 

                            ""But Dad, you told us family was more important than material possessions."" 
 

                            ""Did I say that? I must have been drunk. Family is important, but that Pokemon card collection under your bed? That's something worth fighting for."" 
 

                            Grabbing the carpet rake, I show him how to arrange the fibres in a pattern that will instantly capture the footprint of anyone who enters without permission. 
 

                            ""What are you doing?"" interrupts Alicia, barging in with a basket of laundry. ""Turning our kids into dysfunctional control freaks? Isn't one generation enough?""

A68,"As Rep. Richard　Corcoran　was unanimously designated the next speaker of the Florida House Wednesday, he lived up to his promise to call for controversial reforms aimed at “cleaning up our own house” and policies such as universal school vouchers. 

“The enemy is not the special interests. The enemy is not the press. The enemy is not any of that stuff,” Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, told the Republican-controlled chamber. “The enemy has always been and will always be us.” 

He laid out what he said is the truth about elected office in Tallahassee: politicians who campaign on one thing and “do another thing once elected;” elected officials who start seeking higher office as soon as they are sworn in; others who use their office to seek well-paying jobs “which we would never have gotten but for our service;” and others who “pander” to the press, avoid tough decisions and cave “to the special interests.” 

“When the political process is more accountable to the people, then, and only then, can we really begin to positively transform the lives of the people in our state,” he said. 

He then ticked off a list of reforms that he said would ideally be changed in law but which he will first pursue by rule: 

▪  Create more transparency in government by requiring every lobbyist “to disclose which bills, which amendments and which appropriations they are trying to influence.” 

▪  Ban elected officials from taking jobs in government for six years after they leave office to “end the practice of legislators padding their pensions.” 

▪  Prohibit legislators from being able to take a job with any company or group that receives any funding from the state to “build an absolute firewall between our private lives and the influence of special interests.” 

▪  And close the “revolving door between the Legislature and the lobbying corps” by passing a constitutional amendment that bans legislators from lobbying for six years after they leave office. Corcoran has planned his slate of proposed reforms for years, working with the 28 fellow Republicans who were elected in 2010 with him and drafting them in a document he calls “The Manifesto.” 

As he spoke, he was greeted with both polite applause and standing ovations from his GOP brethren, even though many of his reforms seemed targeted at them. 

In the front row was a lineup of former House speakers — Democrat Lee Moffitt, Republicans Tom Feeney, Larry Cretul and Will Weatherford. All but Weatherford have registered to lobby the Legislature before the six-year window Corcoran seeks. 

While Corcoran made no mention of his “manifesto,” he explained that the changes must go beyond process and focus on broad reforms — in the education system, the justice system, and the judiciary. 

Corcoran stopped short of calling for universal education vouchers but called for lawmakers to “fully fund the right of all parents to choose what school best meets their child’s needs — regardless of whether it’s public or private, religious or secular, or home school or virtual school.” 

Taking aim at the Florida Supreme Court, which has ruled that offering every parent education vouchers violates the constitution, Corcoran called for 12-year term limits for all judges. 

 He called for criminal justice “metrics” that show which criminals are getting the harshest and longest sentences, and he called for safeguards “to guarantee that justice in this state is never governed by the color of a person’s skin or the size of their wallet.” 

And Corcoran, who has spent his four years in office opposing Medicaid expansion and Obamacare, derided the “two-tiered health care system” and the state system that protects hospital profits at the expense of the poor. 

“It’s time people realized that conservatives aren’t against health care for poor people, we’re against giving them poorly run government health care,” he said, as his House members applauded but many Senate Republicans — notably Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando — remained seated. 

Finally, he called on his colleagues to “serve a purpose greater than ourselves” and “sacrifice our own interests” telling the story of Jack Mashburn, a distant relative of his wife’s, who in 1952 as a 22-year-old legislator changed the law that banned blacks from the beach only to be told by the racist leaders of his Panama City town that he’d be voted out of office. 

“Either you hear that story as a cautionary tale, or you hear it how I hear it — as a story of a person who put principle over politics,” he said. “…We can stand and fight, regardless of the cost, regardless of the consequences, regardless of the opposition.” 

 Both friends and rivals commended Corcoran for his call to action, but many also doubted he would succeed. 

Rep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, who will be the House Democratic Leader in 2016. called Corcoran’s ideas “a very aggressive agenda.” But she opposes putting term limits on judges and, having worked in a public defender’s office, she has questions about whether it’s a good idea to ban lawmakers from accepting jobs in government. 

And on the same week Corcoran was urging independence from the special interests, the political committee he runs to re-elect Republicans was hosting nearly a dozen fundraisers in Tallahassee to collect checks from special interests and lobbyists. 

“I commend him for wanting to step outside the boundaries of Tallahassee and tackle the problem,” said Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano, Corcoran’s friend of 30 years who spent 19 years in the Legislature and attended the speech. “But you can’t go up there and say we’re going to overhaul the influence of special interests and then five minutes later take a check from those same special interests. If he wants to lead, he has not start with himself and he has to start now.” 

Corcoran responded that he knows there will be cynics and doubters but he believes there are legislators who want to give it a try. “It’s confront the brutal facts, and the brutal fact is ... man is flawed and if left to their own devices, they’re going to try to seek their self-interest,’’ he said.

A69,"President Obama sees the pathway to a clean energy future and confronts fossil fuel interests that are blocking progress and stifling free markets. With the Paris Climate COP only months away, the heat is on world leaders to back big talk with viable plans for future climate action. Earlier this week, President Obama, at the forefront of the global stage, kicked off a 100-day climate tour with an impassioned presentation at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas.

Always the effective orator, Obama set a hopeful vision for a clean energy future, focusing his message on both the imperative and the financial benefits of immediate and decisive climate action.

“We’re here today because we believe that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future than climate change,” he said. “But we’re also here because we are deeply optimistic about American ingenuity. We think we can do good and do well at the same time. We believe we have the power, dynamism, and creativity to solve a big problem while keeping the engines of the American economy moving.”

For climate action advocates, Obama’s tenure has had its highs and lows. On one hand, during his presidency, America become one of the largest producers of dirty energy (oil and natural gas) in the world, and decisions like approving oil drilling in the Arctic have been unfathomable at best.

On the other hand, we’ve become a major player in clean energy, which undeniably has boosted our economy and created well-paying jobs. We’ve also become more aware of sustainability issues, enhanced our energy efficiency, and decreased emissions. This progress is due, in part, to federal mandates, including stringent fuel efficiency standards on vehicles and appliances, as well as the implementation of green building programs at federal, state, and local levels.

Obama’s Clean Power Plan promises to help us further clean up our act. Providing the first-ever framework to reduce pollution from power plants, the Clean Power Plan requires states to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030. 

Through the Recovery Act, the Obama administration has bet big on a clean energy future, investing in clean technologies with the hope that the private sector would follow suit. Fortunately, the bet paid off: our nation’s solar and wind industries are stronger than ever, with exponential year after year growth, thousands of clean energy projects across the country, and tens of thousands of high-paying jobs.

A70,"The 2015 edition of the BFI London Film Festival is set to celebrate feisty females, as festival director Clare Stewart declared it the “year of the strong woman”. 
 
Alongside opening film Suffragette, which stars Oscar-winner Meryl Streep as Emeline Pankhurst, and American Express gala Carol, featuring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as lesbian lovers, there are other films showing women in front on screen and behind the cameras. 
 Carey Mulligan in Suffragette (Pathe/20th Century Fox) 
“It’s a strong year for strong roles for women across our headline galas. We have the great opportunity by opening with a stunning film like Suffragette to amplify the focus on what is happening for roles for women and girls, in terms of their representation in front of the camera,” she said. 
 
“Also, to look at the question of how women directors are currently faring as well. So we’ve chosen that as our focal point of our discussion in a year where we have a huge array of films on offer as ever.” 
 
With more than 235 films being shown at this year’s event, and 45 films directed by female filmmakers, it can be hard to narrow down which ones to watch. 
 
Here are Clare’s top film recommendations for this year. 
   Promoted stories   
Suffragette 
 [embedded content] 
Suffragette, starring Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter, will kick off the opening night of the 2015 LFF with a star-studded premiere. 
 
“Suffragette is an urgent and compelling film – made by British women, about British women who changed the course of history and it is, quite simply, a film that everyone must see,” Clare said. 
 
The film, which is directed by Sarah Gavron and written by The Iron Lady’s Abi Morgan, opens in cinemas on October 12. 
 
Carol 
 [embedded content] 
Directed by Todd Haynes, Carol – starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as two women who fall in love in 1950s New York – will have its UK premiere on October 14. 
 
Clare said: “Carol is a deeply romantic, emotionally honest love story and is also cinema at its most intoxicating and immaculate. It’s Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara falling in love.” 
 
The film will open in cinemas on November 27. 
 
Trumbo 
 [embedded content] 
Jay Roach’s biopic about blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo is played out on the big screen here, with Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston as the titular character. 
 
He is supported by Dame Helen Mirren as US gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and Diane Lane as Trumbo’s wife Cleo Fincher. 
 
“Diane Lane and Helen Mirren – one holding, the other attacking the fort – in our Accenture gala Trumbo. Diane plays the character who really holds the fort while Trumbo’s in the firing line and Helen plays a character who’s very much attacking Trumbo,” Clare said. 
 
The film opens in cinemas on January 22, 2016. 
 
Brooklyn 
 [embedded content] 
Saoirse Ronan takes the lead in John Crowley’s period drama, which has been written by Nick Hornby. The Irish star plays young Irish immigrant Eilis Lacey, who swaps her homegrown comforts for the intoxicating excitement of 1950s Brooklyn. 
 
Clare said: “Saiorse Ronan gives such an extraordinary performance in the heart-wrenching film Brooklyn, which is based on the Colm Toibin novel.” 
 
Brooklyn, which also stars Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters, opens nationwide on November 6. 
 
The Lady In The Van 
 [embedded content] 
Dame Maggie Smith portrays an eccentric homeless woman who parked her battered Bedford van in playwright Alan Bennett’s driveway – and then remained there for 15 years in the big-screen adaptation of his play. 
 Dame Maggie Smith in The Lady In The Van (Sony Pictures) 
Clare explained: “Maggie Smith is the irascible Miss Shepherd in The Lady In The Van, this woman of an indeterminate age who parks her van in Alan Bennett’s driveway and stays there for 15 years.” 
 
The film, which also stars Alex Jennings and appearances by Dominic Cooper, James Corden and Jim Broadbent, opens in cinemas on November 13. 
 
Steve Jobs 
 [embedded content] 
Michael Fassbender may play the late Apple co-founder, with Seth Rogen as his partner Steve Wozniak, in Danny Boyle’s biopic, but it is Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, a member of the original Mac team and the NeXT team, who steals the spotlight. 
 
Clare said: “Kate Winslet plays Joanna Hoffman in the Steve Jobs biopic, which is the closing film for the festival. This is a really stunning performance – she is the person who can hold her own against that iconoclastic leader (Jobs).” 
 
Steve Jobs, which closes the festival on October 28, will open nationwide on November 13. 
 
He Named Me Malala 
 [embedded content] 
There is no one quite as extraordinary as Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist and Nobel-prize laureate. 
 
Davis Guggenheim’s documentary about the 18-year-old, who was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen after speaking for the girls’ education in her region of Swat Valley in Pakistan. 
 
The film opens nationwide on November 6. 
 
Room 
 [embedded content] 
“Lenny Abrahamson’s amazing Room is based on the story by Emma Donoghue, who also wrote the script,” Clare explained. 
 
“It’s an extraordinary performance by Brie Larson as a woman who’s been living in captivity and bringing up her child, who was birthed by her kidnapper,” Clare explained. 
 
The big-screen adaptation, starring Jacob Tremblay as the young child Jacob, opens in cinemas nationwide on January 29, 2016.

AMITA Health Adventist Medical Center, Hinsdale and AMITA Health Adventist Medical Center, La Grange are seeking volunteers for the No One Dies Alone program, which supports patients who are dying.
Volunteers are needed to serve as compassionate companions who will provide support for persons who are dying, and have no family or friends to sit with them.
“We wish to give dignity to all who are dying by providing a loving presence during their final hours,” said Aleksandra Tanurdzic, manager of pastoral care at AMITA Health Adventist Medical Center, La Grange. “We believe in patient-centered care, and we believe that no one should die alone. This program will be another way in which we extend the healing ministry of Christ.
“It is also a journey for the volunteers who will be spending time with the dying person,” Tanurdzic said. “Sitting with someone in their final hours is a profound experience. It is a sacred and unique time.
“Also, it means a great deal to our nurses and other medical staff members to know that their patients are not alone,” she said.

Volunteers who wish to serve as compassionate companions will receive training on the physical needs of the dying from clinical managers and nurses, although volunteers will not provide any medical care. They will also be trained on spiritual needs by pastoral care staff members.
Volunteers will rotate through two-hour shifts until the patient dies. During the shift, the compassionate companion may speak with the patient, hold his or her hand, or simply be present at bedside. Books and music will be provided.
Volunteers must be at least 18 years old, and must not have experienced the death of a family member or friend during the past year.
The No One Dies Alone program was started by Sandra Clark, RN, in 2001 at PeaceHealth Medical System in Eugene, Oregon.

A73,"Carrie Derick of the Montreal Suffrage Association, who managed to stay out of trouble during the Conscription Crisis, by making ambiguous statements in the Press, rather than ambivalent ones.
In June, 1917 the Press was reporting that Prime Minister Borden was likely going to give Canadian women the vote for the next election.
By September, 1917, it was clear only women with men at the front, brothers, sons, husbands, would get to vote.
What happened in between?
Well, that narrative will provide the climax of the book I am working on, Service and Disservice, a follow up to Furies Cross the Mersey.
Furies Cross the Mersey covers the Canadian Suffragists from 1910 to 1913 and Service and Disservice will cover the WWI years.
Mrs. Pankhurst and her troops figure in both books, in spirit and, occasionally, in body.
According to Pierre Berton, in his book Marching As to War, what happened was that Arthur Meighen, Borden's Right Hand Man, met Nelly McClung out West and she warned him that many women living out there would not support Conscription. Berton claims McLung was the one who floated the idea of limited franchise.
Of course, she could have suggested not letting NEW Canadian women vote out West, but then Quebec women would get the vote and that was no good either, in the minds of Win-the-War types.
And they weren't shy about saying it, either.
So, on Augusts 2, 1917, at the Win-the-War meetings in Toronto, Borden (or Meighen) took a few Women's leaders aside (leaders of the WCTU, IODE, The National Council of Women and the National Equal Franchise League run by Constance Hamilton) and asked them to poll their Canada-wide membership to see if women would support his Union Government and, by extension, his Conscription Bill if they were allowed to vote.
The Leaders did just that and the answer came back an resounding NO.
I recently read a hairy account of these very Win-the-War meetings in Toronto in the Women's Century, the organ of the National Council of Women.
It seems the women of Canada were only given 48 hours notice that they were invited, which means that this was a last minute decision on the part of the Borden Government.
A few speakers were invited especially to 'educate' the women: One women who had three sons at the Front was blunt about why Conscription was necessary: to increase the odds of her own sons surviving.
Not a very noble reason, if you think about it. More of a selfish one.
""If we don’t send men to the front, we can’t get back our boys who are there. Those men who have kept our home and our liberty for us."" A ""great war veteran"" said: “What we want is a union, a common platform of sacrifice and duty to be distributed all over the country."" So, these Society women got all caught up in the emotion of it all and then, later on, the suffragists among them got caught up in their own ambivalence/hypocrisy.
The suffrage leaders had to backtrack, claiming publically that they OPPOSED limited franchise on principle, because many among their membership did.
The minutes of the Montreal Council of Women show that they supported WWI from the start. The yearbooks says, ""most women were away in the country when war broke out' but they soon got their act together and started a Khaki League, to provide soldiers with convalescent care, clean laundry and 'wholesome' entertainment. Miss Derick was appointed President.
(Most Suffrage leaders had long expressed their support of Conscription, but in Montreal, the Local Council was forced to say in the Press that it never supported Conscription, not technically. It supported Mandatory National Service for both men and women. (Their minutes show otherwise.) LOL. Still, President Grace Ritchie England stumped for Wilfrid Laurier in the 1917 election and suffered an impeachment hearing for it.)
Mrs. Torrington, the President of the National Council of Women, also had an especially hard time of it. She too was chastised for speaking on behalf of the entire MCW membership on these touchy political issues when she hadn't been given the mandate. It was easy to see why she did, though.
The Woman's Century Magazine printed another article in September, 1917, revealing that an official resolution was passed by the National Council of Women protesting against Borden's Dominion Franchise Bill - and sent to his office.
Then the article immediately goes on to explain why Limited Franchise is a very good thing. Did you know that many POW's caught by the Allies were Canadian Germans fighting for the enemy?  Did you know that 'foreign' women voted in greater proporation than British born women, in the provincial elections?
""The greater is hidden in the lesser"" with this Dominion Franchise the author of the article, suggesting  the Suffragists of Canada had found a way to trick Borden into giving women the vote, one parcel at a time.
(Borden told some suffrage leaders that this Limited Franchise was a way to let fighting men vote, through their relations.)
Whatever excuse worked.
I have a letter Borden sent to the Fédération St. Jean Baptiste in Quebec, in answer a letter of protest. Borden says he has sent the very same letter to another angry group.
The PM sounds very frazzled in the letter. ""Don't you realize how hard it is for me?"" he writes. ""Would you want a woman who had been in Canada just 3 months to be allowed to vote, because she married a British Subject?""
In the Press he was claing that ""the Women of Canada support my Dominion Franchise Bill.""

A74,"You may have seen that ridiculous campaign the other week. The one with a baby breastfeeding on a burger. It made me feel a bit cross. And then want to go out and get a burger. Jokes aside though, this is just another thing for vulnerable new mums to worry about. Why can't we stop scaremongering new mums and focus on supporting them instead? 

Breast vs. bottle vs. coke? 

So apparently the debate is no longer just breast vs. bottle. It's now breast vs. bottle vs. coke. 

This campaign to get mums to eat healthily may only be in Brazil. For now. But the wonders of social networking mean that far more have seen it. And a high proportion of these are vulnerable new mums. Sat at home on their sofa. Nursing their babies. Having trouble nursing their babies. Wondering when the endless days of having a baby attached to their boob are ever going to end. 

How is it helpful to then be told that what they are giving their baby from their own body might be harming their baby? That what they are giving them is the equivalent of a burger or a can of coke. 

I mean, come on. Really? 

Preying on the vulnerable. 

As a (semi) rational human being of a now 14 month old, I can see that this campaign is silly. 

But the problem is new mums are not rational. I know this first hand. Three times over. They're sleep deprived. They're hormonal and emotional. They're already questioning so much and thinking that they're doing EVERYTHING wrong. Then they see a picture like this and are wracked with yet more guilt. 'Am I really harming my baby?' they think. 'When on earth am I going to find time to make myself something healthy? Arggghhhhhh!' 

Cue more pressure and angst that new mums just don't need. 

The reality is a galaxy far, far away from your five-a-day. 

Breastfeeding is time consuming. 

In the early weeks you literally do nothing but nurse your baby. Beyond this, some babies are fussy and might struggle to get into a feeding routine. They seem to nurse ALL DAY LONG. 

So when, exactly, are new mums expected to look after their own nutrition? When are they supposed to make a healthy meal or think about eating their five-a-day? The reality is, it's often far easier to reach for a slab of cake or a couple of chocolate digestives. 

Just to tied the hunger over. 

Have your cake and eat it. 

With my first baby, I tried to get into good habits. 

When Daddy Pig was on paternity leave, I would have a two litre bottle of water by my side at all times. And a bowl of unsalted cashew nuts and dried apricots. 

This lasted for about as long as his paternity leave. Two weeks. 

Then he went back to work. And I hit the cake. HARD. 

Three kids in and I haven't looked back. 

Ditch the guilt. Now. 

So, forget it, new mums. Forget it. 

You are NOT giving your baby Coca Cola. (And if you are, then I've given my kids a lot worse. Believe me. Which, actually, might explain a lot.) 

Plus I have it on good advice (from a midwife who oversaw my friend's triplet pregnancy) that if the only thing you can eat is a burger, there is nutrition and, more importantly, calories in this. Breastfeeding mums need calories. FACT. 

I'm not advocating you don't try and eat some of your five-a-day (bananas or an apple are easy to grab on the run). I'm just saying NOW is not the time to overhaul your diet or become neurotic about consuming pomegranate seeds and seaweed. You've got enough going on. Cut yourself some slack. 

And, whilst you're at it, a big piece of cake. 

A less bitter pill to swallow. 

If you are concerned about what you're eating (or what you're not eating), there are other ways, simpler ways to help yourself along a bit during this challenging period (because it does get easier, it does). 

Like taking a multivitamin. Under the Healthy Start scheme, pregnant women, women with babies under a year and children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins. Take-up is being encouraged (this is not the same as getting free Calpol on the NHS). Just pop into your local pharmacy and ask if they're participating (many are and can register you there and then). 

Quick and easy. Just what new mums need, right? 

New mum superfood salad. 

If you do, by some miracle, find yourself with a moment or, better still, a helpful friend or relative, get some of this down you. 

An easy, peasy, tasty salad packed full of good stuff, that I pretty much live on (when I'm not gorging on burgers, obviously). 

Because unlike lots of salads, it isn't bland. It tastes blooming good. And it takes less than 5 minutes to prepare (once you've roasted the potato. But if you buy a biggish sweet potato and a couple of avocados, this will easily last you four lunches). Serve it with a pitta bread for a bit more bulk. 

Why not alternate it with the burgers and coke? Ha ha. 

Also? It's the perfect entree to a BIG slab of cake. 

(Which you totally, totally deserve. Because you're doing great.)

Christian rock band Switchfoot and musician Jeremy Camp will host A Night of Rock & Worship at 7 p.m. Thursday at First Arena in Elmira. 

After gaining a foothold in the contemporary Christian music scene, Switchfoot went mainstream with 2003’s “The Beautiful Letdown,” a double-platinum album that straddled the line between sacred and secular rock music. It spawned the hits “Meant to Live” and “Dare You to Move.” 2005’s “Nothing Is Sound” debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and went gold, sparking another radio hit in “Stars.” 

In recent years, the band’s album “Hello Hurricane won the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album, followed by “Vice Verses” and 2014’s “Fading West,” which stretched beyond the typical constraints of the three-minute pop song, experimenting with unusual instruments and musical textures. 

Jeremy Camp is not only a musician but an ordained minister.   (Photo: Provided) 

Camp, an ordained minister, recently released his eighth studio album, “I Will Follow.” The first single off the new record, “He Knows,” discusses the comfort he says he received from God in troubling times: He lost his first wife to cancer at age 21, and in recent years he lost a baby to miscarriage with his wife, Adrienne. 

Tickets for Thursday’s performance are $55 for reserved floor seating or $25 for general admission; purchase online at firstarena.com. First Arena is located at 155 N. Main St. in Elmira.

A76,"(CNN) -  
Secretary of State John Kerry has tapped a former career diplomat as an ""email czar"" to coordinate the State Department response to the myriad of document requests mostly related to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, which have strained the department's resources, officials familiar with the appointment tell CNN. 
 
Janice Jacobs will serve as Kerry's State Department's Transparency Coordinator, charged with responding to Freedom of Information Act and congressional requests faster and more efficiently and improving the State Department systems for keeping records. 

Kerry has sought to balance between trying to ensure the department promptly responds to the various requests without directly undercutting his predecessor and the Democratic party's presidential front-runner. Privately aides say he has been annoyed at the distraction the controversy has caused for his department, which has at times overshadowed his diplomatic efforts. 

One senior official said Jacob's appointment was ""born out of frustration"" on Kerry's part that the State Department has come under fire by federal judges and members of Congress alike for not being responsive to requests by the public and Congress for documents, particularly over the past six months as questions about Clinton's use of a private email server have prompted an influx of inquiries and lawsuits. 

The official added, ""He is also bothered frankly by unfair criticism of some of our public servants that have been working hard without enough resources."" 

In July a federal judge lashed out at the State Department for what he called ""dragging their feet"" by delaying for four years FOIA requests from the Associated Press about Clinton's schedules at State and documents related to Clinton's close aide Huma Abedin's special employment status at State. 

Both Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and Trey Gowdy, chair of the House Select Committee on Benghazi have both accused the State Department of stonewalling document production to their many inquiries. 

""Now that the agency is dedicating itself specifically to resolving the backlog of requests, I expect to begin receiving responses to my questions in a rapid fashion,"" Grassley said in a statement Tuesday. 

A spokesman for Gowdy's committee, Jamal Ware, said the appointment reflected an admission by the State Department that it had not been complying with the group's information requests. 

""Adding another person to State's bureaucracy to address the problems caused by former Secretary Clinton's unusual and unprecedented email arrangement will mean little if State does not address the obstacles that currently exist with its compliance,"" Ware said. ""The proof will be in timely production, not late promises."" 

Officials say Kerry tapped Jacobs for her experience in leading reform efforts. As Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services in 2002, she was at the center of a major effort to revamp visa issuance policies and how the State Department shared information with law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The State Department was under pressure at that time to show it could prevent terrorists from entering the country with valid U.S. visas in the future, which led to historic changes in Jacobs' office. 

She would later become Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs in 2008, until she retired last year. In that post, she was tasked with clearing up a backlog of passport applications following new requirements for travelers entering the US by air to have passports. The record number of applications led to a massive backlog that caused long delays for millions of Americans attempting to travel abroad. 

Officials said a ""large volume"" of the FOIA requests and congressional inquiries over the past six months have been related to the widening controversy over Clinton's email usage. 

The ever-increasing number of requests and investigations, they say have put a burden on State Department personnel. In addition to bureaus who need to vet the emails for possible redactions, legal advisers and other personnel have also been brought in to deal with various lawsuits that keep growing. 

Separate from the Clinton email release, the department is the defendant in more than a dozen other FOIA lawsuits relating to Clinton's tenure, with additional document production deadlines to meet for those requests. 

Requests are also now piling up for documents from her former aides. In addition, the House Select Committee on Benghazi investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission has tasked the State Department for all documents related to Libya over a several year period -- a request that officials say could take years. 

In May John F. Hackett, the Acting Director of the Office of Information Programs and Services wrote about the problem in a letter. 

""Even though we are trying to be responsive, there is still a perception we aren't cooperating because when one is closed out there is a new one,"" another official said. ""This is a problem that just builds on itself. "" 

In instances where the State Department has met its document release obligations, the review process itself has come under criticism for failure to redact certain sensitive information, including information from foreign government sources, which some in congress and the broader intelligence community say should be classified. 

The State Department has been working in conjunction with a team of intelligence community personnel to vet Clinton's 55,000 pages of emails ahead of their public release, making redactions and classification upgrades as they go. In July, the State Department fell behind in meeting its monthly production quota set by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, but reviewers made up the deficit in August and ultimately exceeded their goal by releasing more than 25% of the former secretary's total email trove. The senior official said Kerry hoped Jacob's appointment would give ""new energy"" to that effort. 

""There is a lot of red tape we need to clean up,"" the senior official said. ""We need someone to cross cut the agencies and bureaus, get information cleared as soon as possible and tie this together."" 

The volume is not just related to the Clinton documents, however. State Department officials say FOIA requests for documents have tripled since 2008 and that the small State Department office which processes the requests is ill-equipped to deal with the volume. As a result, the senior official pointed to a ""stove-piping of requests that has not led to efficiencies."" 

""Secretary Kerry's view is that the FOIA process is overwhelming and not properly resourced. The result has been a fairly sclerotic process and he wants to get someone in here working through all this."" 

In addition to ensuring documents are provided to Congress and released publicly in a timely manner, Jacobs will be expected to work with other agencies and the private sector to implement best practices and new technologies to improve the State Department's systems.

A77,"Principal Jerry Mayes with a group of students. Photo courtesy of Erin Woggon. 
 
The principal’s office at duPont Manual High School is a place of distinction. It’s no secret the school is among the nation’s best. 
 
In that office, Jerry Mayes effuses a palpable ambition. But in an apparent paradox, his most salient quality is humility. 
 
“I take what we do seriously,” he says, “but I don’t take myself very seriously.” 
 
When Mayes recounts his journey to the prestigious post, he makes scant mention of the attainments that landed him there. The principal himself seems mystified, being loath to own that his merits indeed commended him for the job. 
 
“What’re the chances of me, out of a nationwide search, becoming the principal of Manual High School? I just feel like for some reason I’m supposed to be here. I don’t know.” 
 
Growing up in Louisville, Mayes wasn’t into sports – which is ironic, considering that he’d go on to become a football coach. His mother, who’d been among the second co-ed class to graduate from Manual, gave him a compulsory introduction to the sport. 
 
“When we went to the Manual-Male football games, I really didn’t know what was going on,” he recalls. “But I knew every Thanksgiving, I had to go to this game or we weren’t eating Thanksgiving dinner.” 
 
When Mayes was in the seventh grade, his parents divorced. “This guy by the name of Milon Perpich became my surrogate father, basically, and all I wanted to do was spend time with him,” he remembers. “And in order to spend time with him, I had to learn how to play sports.” 
 
Mayes graduated from Butler Traditional High School then earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Morehead and UofL, respectively. 
 
He took his first teaching job at Paul Blazer High School in Ashland, Ky., where he worked for two years. Then, he moved to St. Xavier High School, where he taught and coached football for about four years. 
 
After that, he accepted a coaching position at Morehead. A few years later, he was back in Louisville at Doss High School, and after that, he returned to St. Xavier as athletic director. 
 
“Then, I had the itch to get back into coaching,” he says. So he took a job as head football coach and advanced biology teacher at Manual. He subsequently became an assistant principal at Pleasure Ridge Park High School, where he spent 10 years. And in fall 2013, he became principal at duPont Manual High School. 
 
Without question, it’s a station of honor. U.S. News and World Report ranked Manual No. 205 in its most current list of America’s best high schools and the second best high school in Kentucky. Niche.com placed it at No. 112 nationally and best in the state. And on TheBestSchools.org, the school came in at No. 45 in the U.S. 
 
“We have great schools all over Jefferson County,” Mayes says, “and each one of them serves a certain purpose. Ours just happens to be this unique set of kids who want to be in a very rigorous setting. I have the hardest working kids in town – no question.” 
 
Last year, Manual’s students earned $63 million in scholarships. The school offers 30 advanced placement courses, meaning students can graduate with as much as two years of college credit. 
 
“We take ownership of every kid in this building,” Mayes says. 
 
Manual boasts exceptionally gifted teachers who regularly meet to discuss their students’ development. “I’m the smallest cog in this wheel,” Mayes says. “I really am. And that’s not some false humility. My biggest thing is to stay out of the way and let these guys do their job.” 
 
Manual has a rich tradition of success, and Mayes preaches it to the freshmen: “When you come in here, understand this is a different cat.” As Mayes speaks, he taps the table repeatedly for emphasis. “… You have to accept carrying the torch for the hundreds of alumni that have gone before you.” 
 
Manual is also rich in socioeconomic diversity. Minorities make up more than a third of its student body. The environment feels a lot like home to Mayes, whose daughters – 23, 20, 17 and 10 – are all adopted. 
 
His wife, Marla Mayes, is a real estate agent with Breland Group Realtors. “My wife is phenomenal,” he says. “… She actually pushed me to go for this position and to do this.” 
 
The statement is illustrative of Mayes’ career, even his personal life – he’s an unassuming man with a record of responding with mastery to a good push. 
 
Mayes turns around the yellow notepad where he’s prepared his comments. Across the top he’s written: “May this be to your glory.” 
 
Mayes doesn’t typically grant interviews, but he’s welcomed this one in the spirit that perhaps his story will inspire someone. “I really lean on my faith,” he says. “… That’s my base. That’s where everything comes from.” 
 
It’s a faith that God makes everything happen for a reason, which is the only way Mayes feels comfortable accounting for his success.

A79,"7:27 p.m. EDT 
 
CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian prime minister elect Malcolm Turnbull promised to focus on improving the country's faltering economy as the public woke up on Tuesday to its fourth leader in two years. 
 
The ruling Liberal Party voted to oust Tony Abbott as prime minister in favor of Turnbull, a multi-millionaire former tech entrepreneur who is hugely popular with the electorate, in a secret ballot late on Monday. 
 
""I'm filled with optimism and we will be setting out in the weeks ahead ... more of those foundations that will ensure our prosperity in the years ahead,"" Turnbull told reporters as he headed to parliament on Tuesday. 
 
Abbott was deposed following months of opinion polls that showed his popularity with the public near rock bottom as Australia's $1.5 trillion economy struggles to cope with the end of a once-in-a-century mining boom. 
 
Turnbull, toppled as leader of the conservative Liberal Party by Abbott in 2009, has consistently been seen as a preferred prime minister. However, his support for a carbon trading scheme, gay marriage and an Australian republic have made him unpopular with his party's right wing. 
 
Turnbull is widely expected to overhaul the cabinet, with current Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has been battling a backlash against a deeply unpopular budget, likely to be replaced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison. 
 
Defense Minister Kevin Andrews, who is overseeing a A$50 billion ($35.70 billion) submarine tender, is also expected to be replaced when Turnbull unveils his ministry later this week. 
 
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who won the party room vote to retain her additional position as deputy prime minister, said she had spoken with international leaders overnight about the leadership change. 
 
The opposition Labor Party was quick to label Turnbull a ""multi-millionaire who lives in a pink mansion on Sydney Harbour"" who was out of touch with everyday Australians. 
 
The change of leaders is the latest sign of political instability in Australia, which has in recent years been convulsed by backroom machinations and party coups that have shaken public and business confidence in government. 
 
Labor's Kevin Rudd, elected prime minister with a strong mandate in 2007, was deposed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010 amid the same sort of poll numbers that Abbott faced. Gillard was in turn deposed by Rudd ahead of elections won by Abbott in 2013.

A80,"UNDER CARLY FIORINA, HP SOLD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PRODUCTS TO IRAN
Via Breitbart News
Carly Fiorina, a Republican candidate president and the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, presents herself on the campaign trail as a hawk on Iran. She’s promising to take a hardline on the regime in Tehran.
However, during her time as the chief executive of HP, she “sold hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of products to Iran through a foreign subsidiary, despite strict U.S. export sanctions,” Bloomberg reports. While running the show at HP, Fiorina thwarted sanctions by dealing with Iran through European and Middle Eastern companies, allowing for the tech company to dominate the market in Tehran. By 2007, HP-made printers accounted for 41 percent of the total market share in the country, the report states.
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
Fiorina’s dealings with Iran were established thanks to a 1997 agreement made between the U.S. company and the Indian-owned, Dubai-based Redington Gulf. As Bloomberg’s Josh Rogin writes, HP was engaging in potentially illegal activity, as U.S. companies were prohibited from exporting to Iran thanks to two executive orders signed by President Bill Clinton in 1995. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started to inquire about HP’s activities overseas following a 2008 Boston Globe exposé that tracked the company’s dealings with Iran. HP responded, denying that it had thwarted the law, but admitting that the company had sold $120 million dollars worth of products to Redington Gulf, which then sent the products to Iran. Fiorina’s previous dealings with Iran were brought up when she ran for the California Senate in 2010. At the time, her campaign spokeswoman denied that HP had committed any wrongdoing while she was CEO. “It is illegal for American companies to do business in Iran. To her knowledge, during her tenure, HP never did business in Iran and fully complied with all U.S. sanctions and laws,” the spokeswoman said, according to the report.But later in the campaign, the Republican candidate changed her tone on the matter, telling the Lady Globes magazine that technology could help Iran reengage with the world. “But isn’t it wonderful that Dell PCs and Apple iPhones are in Iran, because this is why we know that a woman has been condemned to be stoned to death because she is accused of adultery… The knowledge that we gain about was going on there is important. It gives us a human face on a brutal regime,” Fiorina said.From 1999-2004, when Carly was serving as HP’s chief executive, the company’s lobbying arm consistently pushed for “unilateral sanctions reform legislation,” Bloomberg found."

A81,"Ireland boss Joe Schmidt declared that his side's World Cup starts now after they claimed a convincing bonus-point victory over Romania. 
 
The 44-10 win at Wembley sees Ireland move to the top of Pool D but their progress to the quarter-finals will depend on tougher tests against both France and, more immediately, Italy next Sunday. 
 
Ireland can guarantee qualification to the knock-out stages if they beat the Italians at the Olympic Stadium but it will be important to finish first too, given reigning champions New Zealand could lie in wait for the runners-up. 
 
""Next week is the pivotal week,"" Schmidt said. 
 
""It's where we can qualify ourselves. The game against France just decides who we play in the quarter-final if we can win next week. 
 
""It's pressure for us and pressure for Italy. That's why people come to a World Cup - they want to see how teams respond to the pressure cooker environment."" 
 
Schmidt added: ""We know we can qualify if we win next weekend. Italy, after a win and a loss, need to win next weekend to qualify. It becomes a last-16 game for us."" 
 
Ireland are sweating on the fitness of Rob Kearney for the match after he injured himself scoring the fifth try shortly after coming on as a substitute. 
 
""Rob was involved in a high-speed play after coming on the pitch and just after scoring the try he's jarred himself,"" Schmidt said. 
 
""We hope it's not too much but the next 24 to 48 hours will tell if he's done anything telling for next week. 
 
""It's through his glute and hip. It happened when his knee hit the ground."" 
 
Losing Kearney would be a blow to Ireland but a number of players put their hand up for selection after a dominant performance against Romania. 
 
Schmidt made 12 changes with Italy and France in mind, but his altered line-up showed few signs of weakness, scoring six tries, including four in the second half. 
   Promoted stories   
Tommy Bowe and Keith Earls crossed the line twice each, before Kearney and Chris Henry added two more late on, and Simon Zebo also staked a claim with an impressive display at full-back. 
 
""There were a number of players who performed really well and will create a big of selection headache for Italy,"" Schmidt said. 
 
""I don't think you're ever totally satisfied. We know we've been imperfect but it's a difficult thing to work through a couple of games where you're heavily favoured."" 
 
Earls' second try was his seventh at World Cups, bringing him level with Brian O'Driscoll as Ireland's top-scorer in the tournament's history. 
 
""It's nice for him to be mentioned in the same sentence as Brian O'Driscoll,"" Schmidt said.  ""Because that's the standard that any Irish player in the backline wants to reach."" 
 
Earls' milestone came in front of 89,267 fans at Wembley, a record attendance at a Rugby World Cup, beating the 89,019 that watched New Zealand beat Argentina earlier in the tournament. 
 
""It's pretty empowering,"" Ireland captain Jamie Heaslip said. 
 
""You try block a lot of it out during the game to be composed but their energy bleeds into the squad. 
 
""When you're digging deep and you're blowing hard they do pick you up. The support has blown the squad away to be honest."" 
 
Romania managed a consolation try late on through Ovidiu Tonita but they were largely outclassed and head coach Lynn Howells is also targeting the remaining games against Canada, who they play next, and Italy for a victory. 
 
""The first two games against France and Ireland, once we knew the draw, it was about competing and showing everybody we can compete at this level,"" Howells said. 
 
""I think we've managed that. Now as far as Romania are concerned we're probably playing a semi-final and a final now."" 
 
There was one success for the Romanian squad as scrum-half Florin Surugiu proposed to his girlfriend on the Wembley pitch after the match.

A82,"On a night when newcomers made their presence known for a short-handed Lincoln Southwest volleyball team, experienced seniors stepped forward when the Silver Hawks needed it most. 

Senior Maddie Kelle had four kills in the fifth set and senior outside hitter Brenna Hansen registered a key ace block and served an ace on back-to-back points to lift the Class A No. 6 Hawks to a 25-16, 21-25, 26-24, 12-25, 15-13 home triumph over No. 9 Lincoln North Star in the season opener for both teams Thursday night. 

After North Star battled from an 8-3 deficit to take a 13-12 lead, Hansen’s block tied the fifth set at 13, then her ace serve put Southwest at match point. After a long rally, senior setter Hailey Bax ended it with a dump shot that the Navigators couldn’t cover. 

Bax had six of her 18 assists in the final set. 

The victory becomes even more significant considering Southwest was without its two senior all-state players, both of whom are Division I college recruits. Allie Davis, a 6-foot-2 Wichita State outside hitter recruit, is still a couple of weeks away from returning to the lineup after two offseason wrist surgeries. 

Senior libero and Northern Colorado recruit Taylor Els is out for two weeks because of disciplinary reasons. 

“This win shows what kind of program we have,” said Hansen, a 5-10 outside hitter who led a balanced Southwest attack with 10 kills, two ace blocks and three ace serves. 

Two freshmen played key roles for Southwest — 5-10 outside hitter Jaden Ferguson who finished with 10 kills and three blocks, and 6-foot Hannah Kelle, Maddie’s younger sister. Sophomore libero Kaitlin Siefkes had 28 digs in place of Els. Setter/right side Rachel Walker, a sophomore transfer from Auburn, had 23 assists and seven kills in her first Class A match. 
 
“It was fun to see all the new players come out and kill it like they did,” said Maddie Kelle, who had 10 kills and three ace blocks. “I know they were all nervous before the match, but once they got out there and settled in, they did great.” 

North Star dominated the fourth set, then battled back from the early five-point deficit in the fifth to take its 13-12 advantage on a Southwest hitting error.

A84,"Teaching your kids how to write computer programs
// Kogonuso

by Marshall Brain Let's say that you have children, and you would like to help them learn computer programming at a youngish age. As the father of four kids, I have tried to approach it from several different angles. What I would like to do here is collect some ideas for parents who are looking for different options.
Let's start with a something important: Every kid is different. Some kids are reading and writing fluently years ahead of other kids. For them, learning to program is probably easier. Some kids have the basic analytical skills a lot earlier than others (Here's a story about a 9-year-old writing full-blown iPhone apps). And so on. You try to expose your kids to programming and it may or may not ""take"" the first time, simply because of these differences. So you wait a few months and try again, or you might try a different approach. Understand that, the first time you try to introduce your kids to programming, your kids might not ""get it"" at all. And that's OK.
The second thing to realize is that real analytical skills often don't start appearing until age 11 or 12 or 13 in many kids, so expecting huge breakthroughs prior to that may be unrealistic.
That being said, there are lots of fun things you can try as early as five or six...

GamesLet's start with a few games. Here are three games that my kids have particularly enjoyed. They teach basic problem solving ideas in different ways:


Magic Pen (wait 15 seconds to see word ""play"")
Fantastic Contraption
Auditorium


If you look around on the web you can find lots of ""problem solving"" games like these three.
Then there is this game, which actually does a very good job of teaching simple programming skills:


Light Bot (the ""Play"" button is on the bottom right, under the ad, after it loads)



I love Light Bot. It will engage kids for a couple of hours, starting at age 7 or 8. Some of the puzzles in LightBot are too hard for kids. There are walkthroughs on YouTube that help.
Prefer games on a tablet or phone? Wired.com recently recommended a robot app here. See also this list.

LOGOAs soon as you try Light Bot it may remind you a little of LOGO - a language for younger kids. You can find out more about it on a page like this:
LOGO Programming
Or jump into Google. There is lots of stuff about LOGO on the Web.

Python for KidsLogo is pretty limited. What if you want to teach your kids a ""real"" programming language? Python may be a good option to try because it is now fairly ubiquitous and it is easy to get started. These tutorials can get you going fast:
Python Turotials
Or type ""Python for kids"" into Google - there is lots of stuff out there.

Bigger efforts One thing that one of my kids enjoyed quite a bit is Lego Mindstorms. This is a Lego robotics kit. I've seen kids as young as six or seven doing meaningful programs with it. It uses a graphical language that is pretty simple to understand. If you don't mind blowing $200, then it is definitely worth a look. If you find that your kid really likes it, you might also look into FIRST Lego League (FLL teams build Mindstorms robots, work on presentations, etc.). One of my kids has been on an FLL team for several years and it has been great for him.
The good thing about Mindstorms is that it lets kids build some interesting stuff. The problem is that, after a month or two, you may find that you have come to the limits of what it can do. [Yes, there are adults on YouTube showing off some amazing, advanced stuff, but I suspect that these people are geniuses.]
A friend recommended this educational system for programming robot simulations. It is free:
RoboMind
Another big effort like this is Phrogram, formerly known as Kids Programming Language. KPL had the huge advantage that it was free and pretty amazing. It came with dozens of sample programs and could do both simple and complex things (for example, a really good pinball machine was one of the samples). But for some reason they killed KPL off and morphed it into Phrogram. Phrogram is $50, and I haven't tried it, but assuming that it is a similar package it might be worth it.
On these pages, a father talks about his efforts to teach programming to his daughter using a tool called Greenfoot:


Teaching my daughter to code - Part 1
Teaching my daughter to code - Part 2
Teaching my daughter to code - Part 3
Teaching my daughter to code - Part 4


Which is interesting. He's able to create some pretty sophisticated stuff with her using object oriented techniques.
In a similar object oriented vein is a free system from MIT called Scratch:


Scratch


My kids played with this for a couple of days.
If your kids would like to create games, here is one option to try:


GameMaker


GameMaker is a pretty sophisticated tool with a lot of options. There are tutorials to help you get started. I would not use this as a ""first foray"" perhaps, but it is something to consider for a second foray.
Also there is a free eBook on creating games with Python which states, ""written to be understandable by kids as young as 10 to 12 years old, although it is great for anyone of any age who has never programmed before"":


Invent with Python


A friend has suggested that this is a nice intro.
One other thing to try is:


Codecademy.com


The tagline is: ""Codecademy is the easiest way to learn how to code. It's interactive, fun, and you can do it with your friends.""

MIT App InventorThis summer my twins (age 12) took a class using the MIT App Inventor. This is an impressive system for creating simple apps on Android devices. The twins were creating simple Android apps on the first day, and went on to create a bunch of apps themselves. They really enjoyed it!
MIT App Inventor
If you would like an introduction, you can find lots of introductory videos like these:

Making Web SitesWhat if your kid wants to make web sites? This is a programming realm now. Here is one free, comprehensive educational experience I have seen:


The Odin Project


Again, this is not for little kids, but definitely possible for teens with the knack. It covers a lot of ground: HTML, CSS, Ruby on rails, Javascript, etc. This could be a career path if your kid really enjoys this stuff - a lot of opportunities are available in the job market.
What about a simple web site, without any programming at all? I would recommend Wordpress. You can get started with it here:


Wordpress: A simple and quick way to create a web site


You can do some amazing things without any code. But it really helps if the kid is ""technical"" and likes putting things together.

Real programming - Stanford's Java ClassMy son (around age 13) started using Stanford's free online Java class and he has gotten a lot out of it. The class includes [youtube http://youtube.com/w/?v=KkMDCCdjyW8] and class assignments that reinforce the concepts discussed in class. The programming environment used in the class is called Eclipse. Eclipse is a full-featured development tool with a great debugger and it is free too. This is the class my son took:
Introduction to Computer Science | Programming Methodology
See also:
CS106A: Programming Methodologies
Our son needed a little encouragement from his parents (i.e. deadlines) to get through the first assignments, but by the time be got to Programming Assignment #4 (writing the code for the game called ""Breakout"") he was completely engaged and extended that basic game in a number of directions without any prompting from us. I feel like this class taught him the essence of being a ""real"" programmer.
Stanford has many classes to explore - click for list. Their offerings represent a valuable resource for anyone wanting to learn programming.
Once comfortable with Java, something like this might be interesting to try - a combination of Greenfoot and Java:

Real programming - C and C++ ProgrammingThe C and C++ programming languages are two of the most widely used programming languages in the world. There are free compilers that are readily available and lots of tutorial information can be found for free. Here are two resources that can help get you started:


The Basics of C Programming
C Programming and C++ Programming


Google is your friend and can help you find tons of other stuff.

Learning to write iPhone and iPad appsWriting apps for the iPhone and iPad is not for newbies, but it is definitely something that middle school and high school students can master if they have a knack for programming. And the audience for these apps is gigantic through the App Store that Apple operates. Here are the steps that you need to take if you want to get started:


Step 1 - Step 1 is to buy a Mac computer from Apple so that you can compile apps. The cheapest entry point is a Mac Mini at $600. A MacBook Pro is a laptop that costs about twice as much.
Step 2 - Once you own a Mac, go to the Mac App Store and download XCode. It is free. This package contains the development environment, the compiler, SDK and libraries, and a simulator so you can test your apps on simulated iPhones and iPads.
Step 3 - Apple offers a series of introductory tutorials:


Start Developing iOS Apps Today
Creating Your First iOS App - Hello, World
Creating Your Second iOS App - Storyboards
Your Third iOS App: iCloud



Step 4 - Take the Stanford class on app development: CS 193P iPhone Application Development. Here is the first lecture:
Step 5 - Once you develop your first app then it is time for Your First App Store Submission - You have to pay $99 to join the Apple Developers Program to take this step.


Google can help you to answer nearly any question or problem you run into as you are learning.

What about Android Apps?After talking about Apple Apps, it is only fair to talk about the Android platform too. Here is the ""official site"":


Building Your First App


It is some pretty technical stuff. A teen with the knack should be able to approach it though. This page follows the same vein:


Want to Learn How to Program for Android? Start Here


Google is your friend, again. Use phrases like ""Getting started with android apps"" and ""How to write your first android app"". Find something that feels comfortable for your teen. Also consider the Standford option: CS193a Android Programming or:
That will get stale as time passes, but it is a nice intro.

The BASIC Stamp (and see below for the Arduino) I have actually had a good bit of luck engaging my 10-year-old in programming using a device called a BASIC Stamp. So I would like to spend a little time here talking about it. It is not cheap, but it has three things going for it:


It combines programming and simple electronics
The programming tends to be very simple
You can do real things with it, or at least things that seem realer (to my kids anyway) than Mindstorms.


We were first introduced to the BASIC Stamp when we found this kit at Radio Shack for $90:
What's a Microcontroller BASIC Stamp Kit
You can also order it here:
BASIC Stamp Activity Kit
The big caveat is that you need to have a computer with a serial port to use it. If you do not have such a computer (most computers made since 2005 don't have a serial port), then you need the USB version of the kit for $160:
BASIC Stamp Discovery Kit - Serial (With USB Adapter and Cable)
And if you are going to do that, I might suggest you consider this robot kit instead, because it is the same price:
Boe-Bot Robot Kit - USB Version
So, already, you can see that the BASIC Stamp is not simple or cheap. We've already had to worry about port types and which kit to get. And if that puts you off, so be it.
But we did buy the kit at Radio Shack, and we did have an older machine with a serial port, and we did get it set up and it did all work and... here is what was amazing about it. My kid could sit down with the book, by himself, and on his own he could wire up little circuits and write little pieces of code and get it all working. The programs and the electronics are easy enough that a 10-year-old can manage it. This is admittedly simple stuff, like wiring up a push button and having it make an LED blink, or making a servo motor turn or making sounds come out of a speaker. But the idea that my kid (who hates reading for the most part) could get this stuff working was impressive. And then he could think of extensions on his own. Trivial extensions, yes, like making two LEDs blink, but extensions.
The nice thing about this approach is that you can buy other pieces at Parallax.com and they are pretty easy to hook up. One of the first things we bought was a PIR module ($10), which is the kind of thing you use in a burglar alarm or an automatic light to sense a warm human body. We also bought a little text LCD panel ($25). And he built a device that could count people as they walked by. If you have a family of six people, how many times do they use the stairs in the house? How many times do they open the refrigerator? With this device you can find out. (The refrigerator was funny - it was opened something like 50 times a day!)
Next thing was a ultrasonic sensor ($30). With that and the LCD display you can build a little ultrasonic tape measure. They have a lot of little sensors like this that you can try. We've used the accelerometer, the thermometer, the RFID tag reader, etc.
His latest adventure is with the GPS module ($90) and the USB memory stick reader/writer ($35), which he used in a science fair project. With the USB memory stick thing, you can plug in a USB memory stick (AKA ""thumb drive"") and read and write files. So you can create a text file and start dumping in data. Then you can hook up the GPS, let it gather data and save the data into the memory stick. With that you can create bread crumb trails everywhere you go. You can then plug the memory stick into your laptop's USB port, load the data into a spreadsheet and do a scatter graph...
...or you can drop the data into Google maps as described here:
Mapping GPS Coordinates using Google Maps
As it turns out, the Parallax GPS is not the greatest. When we first hooked it up, it would never get a lock on the satellites. After an hour of probing on Google, we found out that you have to mount the GPS about 10 inches away from the Stamp (because of electrical noise generated by the Stamp). It would have been wonderful if this fact had been revealed in the Parallax documentation. But even after you do that, this device can have trouble getting a lock sometimes (ours doesn't work at all in rainy weather, for example). It does work in the car if you put it on the dashboard, but not from the interior. [All of these problems eventually led us to a site called Sparkfun.com, which has a much better selection of GPS modules that are slightly less easy to use.]
It also led us looking for material on the web about the BASIC Stamp. There is a lot of it. For example, there are people building autopilots from BASIC Stamps:


Basic Stamp autopilot tutorial, part 3 (this is the page that taught us not to put the GPS on the Stamp board)
BASIC Stamp UAV code now in beta


You can find all kinds of stuff like that. Then you discover that there are many other platforms more advanced than the Stamp, like for example the Arduino, the Teensy, the Microchip PICkit (see also this book and this book), the Gumstix, etc.

The ArduinoSince this article was first written, the Arduino platform has really taken off and replaced the BASIC Stamp in the hearts and minds of hobbyists. There are so many different flavors of Arduino, so many different accessories, so many different kits, that it is now a very rich environment, and a lot of fun.
Here are some examples of different kits available:


Arduino Kits
Kits
Arduino Kits
Arduino stuff
Sensor kit
Programming Arduino: Getting Started With Sketches


The easiest way to get started with the Arduino is to buy one (for example, buy an Arduino Uno) and start programming. This article is a great introduction to getting the development environment downloaded to your machine and starting to program:
Arduino How To
The first time I tried it, it did not work. There were two settings (the type of Arduino and the com port) that I had to set, and the article provided guidance. We have purchased a number of accessories, including this touch screen, and have had a lot of fun with Arduinos.

The Raspberry Pi Then there is the Raspberry Pi - a very small but complete computer that fits in your hand. You hook it up to a keyboard, mouse and monitor and turn it on. It boots up a version of Linux and you can start programming. It comes with Scratch (see above) and Python and can easily handle other stuff. It can also send signals to hardware like Stamps and Arduinos do. I own a Pi, its camera, a relay board, etc. My kids and I have played with it. But for some reason it never really caught on with them.

A87,"T his morning, Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz firmly rebuffed the demands of a growing intra-party insurrection over her planned presidential debate schedule, which Democratic candidate Martin O’Malley says is “rigged” in favor of Hillary Clinton. 
 
“We’re going to have six debates. Period,” Wasserman-Schultz told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday. The DNC chair shrugged off calls from O’Malley, Bernie Sanders, and two DNC vice chairs to hold more debates and scrap its so-called “exclusivity clause,” which punishes candidates who participate in any additional debates. 
 
“We are not changing the process,” she stressed. “We are having six debates, and candidates will be uninvited from any subsequent debates if they accept an invitation to a debate outside of the six DNC-sanctioned debates.” 
 
Wasserman-Schultz’s defiance comes in the face of a burgeoning revolt over the DNC’s debate rules, sparked by O’Malley’s speech at the Democratic party’s summer meeting in Minneapolis two weeks ago. In front of the assembled DNC delegates — and just feet away from Wasserman-Schultz — O’Malley said the limited debate schedule was “rigged” to benefit Clinton, whose front-runner status is rapidly diminishing. Fellow candidate Bernie Sanders agreed, joining O’Malley’s call to expand the debate schedule and scrap the exclusivity clause. 
 
On Wednesday, two top Democratic officials threw their lot in with the insurgents . DNC vice chairs Tulsi Gabbard and R.T. Rybak said that Wasserman-Schultz’s current debate schedule “limits the ability of the American people to benefit from a strong, transparent, vigorous debate between our Presidential candidates.” Gabbard is a congresswoman from Hawaii, and Rybak is the former mayor of Minneapolis. 
 
O’Malley called out Wasserman-Schultz directly on MSNBC Thursday morning, again accusing the chair of “rigging” the process and “circling the wagons” around Clinton’s candidacy. Allow Debate, an O’Malley-affiliated political group, is planning a September 16 protest in front of the DNC’s Washington, D.C. headquarters. 
 
Appearing unmoved by the uprising, Wasserman-Schultz explained to the assembled reporters that the schedule was designed to give all candidates adequate time to prepare. “It’s labor-intensive to prepare for a debate,” she said. “A responsible candidate comes off the road, has to devote time and staff resources and personal time getting prepared. Because of this window that we’re in, where we have the early-primary states that have that retail form of communicating, that’s also labor intensive, it’s important to make sure we give the candidates a schedule that allows them to really engage in that process.” 
 
And she laughed off the accusation that she’s rigged the schedule for Clinton’s benefit. “A couple of days ago, I think it was [the] Drudge Report who said that I obviously delayed the first debate to mid-October because I’m in the tank with Joe Biden,” she said. “So every day, someone is going to say something about my intentions. Like I said, I have a party to run.”

It's probably my second favorite city in Morocco. There is part of it that is almost like any big modern cities, but part of it that is very Moroccan. My favorite part of the city is probably joining the crowd at the main square where there are tons of food stalls, shopping, drummers, dancers, monkey acrobats, snake charmers, fortune tellers, jugglers, old medicine men, etc.
It's actually my last day in Morocco today. On my first day here, I walked passed a coffee place with only men sitting outside facing the street...it was intimidating. As a woman, I wondered if I was allowed to go in. If you do go in, men will stare at you as if you've done something wrong. It's still a men's world here...but I've met Rachida, a very independent woman...she taught me a lot about Moroccan culture. There are women who push and fight, women who drive cars, women in parliament, polygamous marriages are almost completely abolished and you're actually allowed to wear short shorts and spaghetti straps in bigger cities (unlike other middle eastern countries). A few years ago, women only went outside twice in their lifetime; on her wedding and on the day she dies. Now, if a man tells a woman to go back home, other women will stand up for her and tell the man to mind his own business.
A lot of things we have in western countries is taken for granted, but we have to remember it's because there were women who fought for us to have those rights. It's such a young country...the older ones resists changes, but try to tell a younger one how it's done and he does exactly the opposite. It's a fascinating country here, and you feel the evolution when you're travelling from the country side to the bigger cities. It was a great lesson.

A89,"WASHINGTON (CNN) — Top-level negotiations between Republican leaders in Congress and the White House to resolve multiple critical budget issues could begin “very soon,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. 
 
But the talks could be marred before even getting started after McConnell insisted in a phone call last week with President Barack Obama that House and Senate Democratic leaders not be allowed at the table, a demand the President refused to accept, multiple officials told CNN. 
 
McConnell has suggested for weeks he expected to open talks directly with the White House, bypassing Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders with whom he has tenuous relations. A spokesman for McConnell wouldn’t comment on why he wanted to bar Democrats from the talks. 
 
White House officials also declined to discuss the call, which took place last Thursday just before Obama met with Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi in the Oval Office, according to a Pelosi aide. But they pointed to recent comments by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest who said that Democrats must be part of any negotiation. 
 
Reid insisted he would be part of any negotiations. 
 
“We’ve been calling for responsible budget negotiations for months,” he said. “If there are any talks, I will be invited.” 
 
McConnell announced at a press conference that the talks were set to begin. 
 
“The President and Speaker (John) Boehner and I spoke about getting started in a discussion last week and I would expect them to start very soon,” he said. 
 
News of the anticipated but long-awaited talks came a day before Congress was set to prevent a shutdown by approving a temporary spending bill to keep the government operating through December 11. The stopgap measure would “allow time for cooler heads to prevail,” McConnell said. 
 
It also came days after Boehner, a known dealmaker, complicated the process by announcing he would leave Congress at the end of October. It was not clear what impact his sudden departure would have on what will be his final major budget negotiation. But some Democrats — who fear Boehner’s replacement will cower to demands from the right not to cut a deal — said they hope Boehner will wrap up all the remaining issues before retiring. 
 
“I would hope that Boehner would make it easier on the people who are going to follow him,” Reid said. “Get it all done before he leaves.” 
 
In an interview on Face the Nation Sunday, Boehner suggested he may want to do just that. 
 
“I don’t want to leave my successor a dirty barn. I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets there,” Boehner said. 
 
Washington faces several deadlines in the coming weeks related to government funding, the debt ceiling, money for highway and infrastructure construction, whether to renew the Export-Import Bank, and a slew of expiring tax provisions that need to be renewed. 
 
Many Republicans want to break existing budget caps to increase spending for defense while most Democrats want to break the caps to increase funding for domestic programs. But the conservatives in the House who helped force Boehner’s exit say they want to rein in government spending and don’t want to break the caps at all. 
 
McConnell said one of his top priorities in the talks will be to set a top line spending figure for this year and 2016, which would allow Congress to carry out a normal appropriations process next year, which will be complicated by the elections. Washington has run on “continuing resolutions” for some time, which don’t allow Congress to make changes to the way money is spent or to alter policies within government agencies. 
 
“Let us at least be honest. With a continuing resolution, no waste will be cut. No spending will be cut. No regulations will be stopped. And the debt will continue to mount,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said in a floor speech explaining why he would vote against the continuing resolution.

A90,"(CNN) -  
Andy Murray will have to wait until next year for another crack at a grand slam. 
 
Suffering an ignominious defeat to South African Kevin Anderson in four sets, Murray looked frustrated and often powerless against the 15th seed who played out of his skin. 

Anderson took the game 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6. 

Murray, the World No. 3, complained to himself and the umpire repeatedly -- often in expletive-laden tirades caught on camera -- about everything from perceived game delays by Anderson to line calls. 

The truth is, it just wasn't his day. 

Going into the match, the 29-year-old Anderson was an unlikely candidate to dominate a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion. 

In his ninth year on the pro circuit, Anderson has had only three tour victories to his name and never advanced beyond the fourth round at a Grand Slam. 

But the 6'8"" Johannesburg native was a force throughout the match, battling nerves only occasionally. He was broken early in the third set before losing it on a tiebreak, before coming back with an assured performance in the fourth set. 

Anderson played aggressively and took chances, pouring 25 aces past a sometimes helpless Murray, who was denied a 20th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal run. 

He hit 81 winners during the match against Murray's 49, and rushed the net 58 times versus 24 approaches for Murray. In fact, Anderson has been the most prolific net player in the entire U.S. Open, often displaying a graceful touch belying his giant frame. 

""I'm a little lost for words right now. I was just trying to keep my composure against Andy, and I honestly played one of the best matches of my life,"" said Anderson, who clinched the fourth set tiebreak to win. 

""He's such a fighter, and such an amazing player, I knew I had to try my best and just stick with it,"" he said. 

Federer raises game to down Isner 

World No. 2 Roger Federer faced No. 13 seed John Isner in the late match in Arthur Ashe Stadium, ultimately handling the big American's serve in three tight sets, winning the match 7-6, 7-6, 7-5. The Swiss player made his way to the quarterfinals for the 11th time with a vintage Federer performance, keeping alive his hopes of raising the trophy at Flushing Meadows for a sixth time. 

Federer kept his nerve throughout, not losing his serve to Isner once. For his part, Isner fought back gamely, only losing his serve once at the very end, and taking nine break points away from the winner. However, he was not able to match his 2011 U.S. Open-best quarterfinal result. 

Obviously John has one of the best serves in the game,"" Federer said after the win. ""You just gotta hang around and make sure you don't drop your serve."" 

The 34-year-old, 17-time Grand Slam men's singles champion has been on form throughout the summer, climbing back up the rankings to breathe down world number one Novak Djokovic. He's next set to play 12 seed Richard Gasquet in the quarterfinals. 

Missing shoes 

Temperatures soared once again on the hard courts of Flushing Meadow in a competitive, and sometimes quirky, eighth day of action at the U.S. Open. 

French Open champion Stan Wawrinka took four sets to cruise past American upstart Donald Young, in a match that saw a bizarre build-up. 

Young -- who had battled back from two sets down in his previous two matches at the Open -- had his locker mistakenly cleared out the day before the match, leaving him scrambling to find equipment until shortly before the match. 

""Unfortunately, I came to the locker room yesterday and I opened it up and it was clean,"" said Young, a former junior World No 1. ""Like a couple shirts missing, all my shoes were gone, and apparently someone said I was out of the tournament, so the guys thought I went home. They were taking some souvenirs."" 

Young showed some signs of life, taking the second set from Warwinka 6-1, before dropping the third and fourth sets. 

Warwinka will face Anderson in an intriguing quarterfinal matchup.

A91,"SOUTHINGTON —Motivational speaker Duane Cashin will provide tips to local businesses on growing their sales at a business forum Sept. 15 at The Ridge Club. 
  
The hour-long event, titled “Building a Pipeline of Sales Opportunity Business Forum,” will begin with registration at 7:30 a.m., followed by a buffet-style breakfast at the golf club at 300 Welch Road. 
 
The forum is hosted by the Southington Economic Development Department in conjunction with the Southington Chamber of Commerce and sponsored by Liberty Bank and Emendee Technologies. 
 
Cashin’s presentation will begin at 8 a.m. and will include a question-and-answer session. Town staff will be on hand to answer legal and permitting questions. 
 
Chamber of Commerce board member and Town Councilor Dawn Miceli, who helped to organize the event with fellow board members Rob Flood and Al Monbaron and Town Economic Development Coordinator Lou Perillo, said Cashin will “provide practical tips that can be immediately implemented by business owners, CEOs, sales managers, sales professionals and more to help drive revenue and gain a competitive advantage to achieve extraordinary sales results.” 
 
Cashin is based in Bristol and gives lectures throughout the U.S. After hearing him speak at another event, Flood recommended him for the forum. 
 
Monbaron, a real estate agent with Century 21 Allpoints Realty, said the idea for the forum was born from the ashes of the chamber’s monthly round-table discussions. 
 
“Their purpose was educational and informational sessions for chamber members,” he said. “However, after a year, meetings were struggling to remain relevant and attendance was starting to wane. I brought my concerns to the rest of our board and we decided to table the meetings while we re-strategized. Dawn spoke with some folks on the town side who were also interested in doing some educational business meetings and had organized one a couple years ago.” 
 
Monbaron said the biggest difference between the business forum and the round-table discussions is the amount of resources available. 
 
“We are now able to commit more to the meetings and bring in quality outside speakers,” he said. “Working with town gives us more leverage as far as attracting the most bang for our buck.” 
 
Miceli, Monbaron and Chamber President Elizabeth Francis encouraged all local business owners, CEOs, sales managers and sales professionals to attend the event, which as of last Tuesday had 70 businesses as registered guests. 
 
“I don’t see any downside,” said Miceli. “It’s a free forum, it’s going to give really pointed pieces of information that will help your business with the bottom line and building sale opportunities and it includes breakfast all for an hour of your time. It behooves every biz to attend.” 
 
Miceli added that additional business forums are being planned for Jan. 12, April 26 and June 14, 2016. 
 
Local businesses are invited to send two representatives to the forum at no cost. Additional guests are $15 each. 
 
To reserve seats for your business, email kellyc@southington.org or call (860) 276-6246 for more information.

A92,"The UN Secretary -General's Special Envoy on Ebola, Dr. David Nabarro, has emphasized the need for the international community to remain fully engaged in its support to boost Liberia's recovery efforts. He also praised the Liberian Government's efforts in tackling the Ebola virus as the country has been re-declared Ebola free. 

Nabarro said particular attention should be paid to key areas such as food security, health systems, and non-Ebola related health services. 

The UN Envoy made the observation when he addressed the business community recently at the US- Liberia Trade and Investment Forum which took place in New York. 

He said that the momentum built during the International Ebola Recovery Conference recently, which generated tremendous international support for national recovery plans of the affected countries should be taken forward. 

""There is a need to build up the public health systems and improve primary care in Liberia and the region. Ebola exploits fragile and overstretched health systems with limited public health capabilities. Therefore, we must prioritize strengthening the health institutions, develop their infrastructure and support the training of the necessary personnel,"" said the UN Envoy. 

Dr. Nabarro, who has worked for over 15 years with the World Health Organization and in the UN Secretariat respectively, said the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the largest and most complex epidemic, posing challenges of epic proportions to the region and the global community.

A93,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Browns took a leap of faith and put Terrelle Pryor on the 53 man roster. 
 
The 4 p.m deadline for final cuts came and went, and Pryor, who's making the transition from quarterback to receiver, was still standing. 
 
Pryor can also serve as the Browns' third quarterback now that they only have Josh McCown and Johnny Manziel on the roster. Backups Thad Lewis and Pat Devlin were among the final cuts. 
 
Pryor played quarterback for three seasons in Oakland, including two when current Browns offensive coordinator John DeFilippo was his quarterbacks coach. 
 
Terrance West was not safe heading into the final cuts a source told Northeast Ohio Media Group, but he's still on the team. The Browns engaged in talks with the Cowboys according to Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle, but the Browns were asking to much. 
 
Meanwhile, rookie receiver Vince Mayle, the Browns fourth-round pick out of Washington State, was waived. The Browns will likely try to add him to the practice squad. Mayle struggled in preseason after undergoing thumb surgery in May. He was inconsistent catching the ball and needs time to develop. 
 
Running back Shaun Draughn was also among the cuts. 
 
Coach Mike Pettine provided some clues that he was leaning toward keeping Pryor after the preseason finale Thursday night in Chicago. That night, Pryor played receiver, quarterback and personal punt protector. 
 
""Anytime you can have a guy that can run, that can throw, that can protect, I just think it changes the mindset defensively a little bit,'' said Pettine, who knows what gives a defense fits. 
 
On Friday, however, Pettine acknowledged it would be 'a leap of faith' to keep the inexperienced wideout on the team. 
 
""It is a project to take a guy that has played quarterback for the vast majority of his football career,'' said Pettine. ""Even if he had stayed completely healthy, I don't know if we would have all the results in or feel 100 percent comfortable. Even if he had gone the whole time and not gotten injured, it certainly it would be a leap of faith."" 
 
Pryor -- who missed most of camp with a strained hamstring -- didn't have a pass thrown his way that night, but he ran his routes with authority, he proved a tenacious blocker and ran the read-option twice, keeping the ball both times for runs of 5 and 4 yards. When his 15-18 snaps were up, his 4.5-yard rushing average was tops on the team, better than West's 3.9-yard average on his nine carries. 
 
""To be out there competing against different guys and getting my chance to put my hands on different guys -- guys who aren't our teammates -- I had a good time,'' said Pryor. 
 
Lewis said of Pryor after the game, ""the guy has a knack for football. He's physically gifted, so he has the opportunity to be great. He just has to keep working at it.'' 
 
Before the game, Pryor stressed that he didn't want anything handed to him. He worked hard at his new craft in the month leading up to camp, training at the Randy Moss Academy in North Carolina with other top receivers. 
 
""I don't want to feel blessed,'' Pryor said. ""Everything I've ever done for my life, sheesh, my mother, growing up I've been by myself, moving in and out of different places by myself since I was 12 years old. I really didn't have like a figure, people to show me the way. I've pretty much grown and anything I have I've worked for it by myself. 
 
""I don't like being given anything. I do want to help the Browns. If that's the opportunity I have, cool, but that doesn't excite me. That doesn't say I've worked for it. When I get on the field I'd say I'm a great teammate. I spend a long time in the facility, I always ask questions, I try to be the best teammate, player I can be. But that doesn't excite me because I want to earn everything I have or get.'' 
 
Pryor also has no regrets about waiting so long to give up on his quarterback dreams and try receiver. He spent three years as a quarterback in Oakland from 2011-2012 and sat out of football in 2014. 
 
""You can't have regrets and you can't look back,'' he said. ""I definitely don't look back in the past because I've been cut three times. This doesn't hurt me mentally. All I can do is look forward and enjoy this time I've been having, having great coaches coach me up every single day, having great teammates right now here in the present. Being a Cleveland Brown, I enjoy it, I love it.'' 
 
Pryor was grateful he had earned the respect of cornerbacks Joe Haden and Tramon Williams before going down with the hamstring injury Aug. 4th. 
 
""It means a lot,'' he said. ""The feeling for me to have a guy like Joe Haden, Dwayne Bowe and guys like that to speak up for me on my behalf. It doesn't get any better than that. You've got Joe Haden, guys you go against and he kind of sees your potential. I appreciate that from Joe, I really do appreciate him and appreciate all my teammates.'' 
 
Haden, for one,  was confident other teams would've given Pryor a chance at receiver if the Browns had given up on him.  Now, he'll get to go against him in practice every day and help him become an NFL receiver.

A94,"As the Strictly stars prepare for their first dances on Friday and Saturday night, one contestant might be slightly more nervous than the rest. 
 
Peter Andre let slip that Olympic runner Iwan Thomas only had his first rehearsal on Thursday – just two days before the celebrities perform live for the first time. 
 Iwan Thomas and Ola Jordan (Ray Burmiston/BBC) 
Speaking to Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1, Peter revealed, “I hope I’m not going to get in trouble! He’s been away. I’m going to put my foot in it.” 
 
Luckily for Pete, Iwan’s professional partner Ola Jordan had already tweeted a picture of the runner on Thursday hinting that they’d been hard at work in last minute rehearsals.

There have been lots of updates from the other contestants as they prepare for Saturday’s show. 
 
Here’s what they’ve been up to: 
 
Ahead of BBC Breakfast’s Carol Kirkwood’s first dance, the morning news show got an exclusive sneak peek behind the scenes at rehearsals.

During the clip, Peter Andre sadly broke the news that he’ll be keeping his shirt on during his performance. 
 
“My abs have been hibernating for a while and I think I’m going to keep them hibernating for a little bit longer,” he said.

Katie Derham showed off her outfit for the show in the video, a sparkly aqua dress with gold fringing. 
 
“I think if you’re going to do Strictly Come Dancing, you’ve got to embrace the whole spangly world. And it don’t get much more spangly than this!” she laughed. 
 
Katie’s also been on Twitter subtly trying to win herself some high marks with the new Strictly emojis.

Irish singer Daniel O’Donnell was spotted trying on his first outfit, a suit which looked a little too small. (Here’s hoping it doesn’t split.) 
 
“I can’t even speak,” he said, as he was measured up. “It’s a little bit tight, but it’s getting loser.” 
 
On Twitter, Georgia May Foote revealed those rehearsals might not have been as easy as they looked – apparently the studio dance floor is a lot harder to navigate than expected. 
  
#strictlyupdate so much harder on the actual dance floor than our rehearsal studio. Hope i can adjust! Everyone feels a little sick today!

The actress admitted she was getting overwhelmed by the steps she had to learn and had to keep sitting on the floor to stop her dizziness. 
 
“It’s a lot more difficult to get the steps in my head and I get overwhelmed by them and they get jumbled up in my head and then I forget what I’m doing and trip over myself, or worse, trip Aljaz over,” Helen confessed. 
 
Finally, thanks to this topless snap of Iwan, we know the celebs have laid down their first base coat of glowing orange tan!

A95,"High schoolers can now earn money for college -- no job required. 
 
Startup Raise.me developed a program that allows high school students to start banking college scholarship money. 

What's the catch? 

The money is tied to students' individual achievements. The better they do in school, the more engaged they are with their communities, the more money they earn from Raise.me's college partners. 

There are 26 colleges on Raise.me's platform, including Penn State, UMass and Tulane. Raise.me cofounder Preston Silverman hopes to increase that to 100 colleges by the end of the year. 

As long as students meet the college's GPA requirements, they can start earning money from as many as they choose -- between $500 to $1,000 per achievement. Students don't get the money until they are accepted to one of the colleges. 

Abby Saxastar raised $80,000 on Raise.me, which will fully cover her tuition at Stetson University, a private college in central Florida. 

""I've always been very successful in school and I've also done a lot of volunteer work,"" said Saxastar. ""But I still had to figure out how to pay for college."" 

Saxastar learned about the program a few months before she graduated high school in June, but the program allows students to retroactively include information. So even as a senior, Saxastar could log her grades and activities for the past four years. 

""My family is digging through some debt and taking out loans for my other expenses,"" she said. ""So getting this scholarship has been amazing."" 

Saxastar is one of 60,000 students from 5,000 high schools who have signed up with Raise.me since it launched in August 2014. The startup has received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Facebook. 

Colleges committed a total of $1 billion in scholarships in the first year, but Silverman said there isn't data on how much of this was actually paid out to students. The goal is to make scholarships available to students who may not otherwise pursue them. 

""Most scholarships today are awarded at the very end of high school. It's too late to influence a student's college search and application process,"" he said. 

Silverman said colleges are on board because it helps them reach students much earlier in the selection process. 

Beatriz Zayas is head counselor at the Southwest High School in El Centro, California, a city on the border with Mexico and Arizona. It's a predominantly rural area, and 90% of the 2,100 students are Hispanic. 

""A high percentage are from low-income families, but we're hoping they will become first-generation college students,"" said Zayas. 

Raise.me could become a critical part of that. There are 60 students at Southwest currently enrolled in the program. Zayas said they opted to focus on a small International Baccalaureate class first, in order to provide the necessary support. 

""It's putting good colleges on the radar of families who wouldn't have known about them otherwise,"" she said. 

Although Raise.me doesn't target a specific demographic, Silverman said 49% of students on the platform are from low-income families. 

A few colleges, including Florida International University, are even offering scholarships specifically to these students. 

The university plans to partner with Raise.me this year to target low-income Florida high schools.

A96,"Radio Rentals owner Thorn Group has been forced to update how it checks its customers' ability to pay for rentals, and is repaying up to $1 million in overpayments to dole recipients.

The moves follow ongoing scrutiny of Thorn by the corporate cop which continues to question its compliance with responsible lending obligations.

But Thorn managing director, James Marshall, has rejected the claims of a former Thorn finance team employee who told Fairfax Media sales at the company had declined by 30 per cent since the update in April to the poverty index figures it uses to determine customers' ability to make repayments.

Responsible lending laws that came into affect in 2010 require lenders to check borrowers' claims about their income and expenditure tally with the known cost of living to ensure any repayments on a loan will not push them below the poverty line.

Mr Marshall said it is true Thorn does not update its figures every quarter because the changes are often minor but there had been a longer ""period"" until April when the figures were out of date for the Henderson Poverty Index that it uses.

The HPI has been compiled by the Melbourne Institute since 1973 and is updated every quarter. As of March 2015, the poverty line was calculated at $958 a week for a couple, one of which is working, with two dependent children. The poverty line in March 2011 was about $874.

Following ongoing discussions with ASIC since April, it is now moving to use other measures to assess creditworthiness, including assessing people's cost of living based on where they live.

""It has become apparent to us that ASIC doesn't really like the HPI. We agree it is a really blunt instrument. EY is now checking on Thorn's procedures for checking customer's ability to pay and will recommend updates to its methods,"" Mr Marshall said.

However, he said there had been no downturn in sales as a result of the change, and ""installations"" of goods that it leases have increased in the past six months compared to the previous corresponding period.

On Friday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission released a report it commissioned from RMIT showing that people were paying the equivalent of up to 885 per cent interest to lease products, and the poorest were paying the highest interest rates.

Mr Marshall questioned the ""subjective"" language of ASIC's report and the size of the sample for RMIT's study, which is based on just two lessors. He said Thorn's repayment rates amount to about 2.6 times the cost price of the product, or 250 per cent.

ASIC said it is continuing investigations into several lessors to check if they are complying with responsible lending laws. There are no formal investigations into Thorn but the regulator confirmed it still has ""concerns"" Thorn is not complying with responsible lending laws. ""We have ongoing concerns about standards of conduct in this market sector, and we are currently reviewing specific lessors for compliance with the requirements of the National Credit Act,"" the regulator said on Friday.

It pointed out consumer lease companies, which as well as Thorn include rival Flexigroup, are not subject to any caps on the margin they can earn on repayments above the actual cost of goods. By contrast payday lenders cannot charge annual rates of more than 48 per cent.

ASIC deputy commissioner Peter Kell said it has submitted its report to the government review of national consumer credit laws. This is looking at whether caps on payday loans are appropriate and whether they should be extended to consumer leases.

Mr Marshall admitted to claims it has been overpaid between $700,000 and $1 million by customers on the dole via a government direct debit system called CentrePay because customers neglect to stop repayments when the lease is paid in full. CentrePay allows people on CentreLink to set up direct payments for essential items like electricity and education.

Mr Marshall put this down to errors in legacy IT systems and said the company is now working on returning the money to customers. He said the amount would not have a significant affect on its 2016 earnings.

A Credit Suisse report published in March estimated half of Thorn's revenue comes from CentrePay. Mr Marshall has said this is inaccurate but Credit Suisse stands by its analysis.

Thorn Group's share price had fallen by 7.2 per cent since Friday morning to $2.32 by the close of trade on Wednesday. It has fallen by 24 per cent since December 31 when it was at $3.11.

The government recently banned any lease company from receiving payments from CentrePay unless it has a credit licence, which Thorn Group does.

On Thursday, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Labor Senator Doug Cameron to ban all lease companies from CentrePay. It still needs to be passed by the House of Representatives.

A97,"“Be still my soul, the Lord is on thy side.  With patience bear, thy cross of grief and pain. Leave to thy God to order and provide. In every change He faithful will remain.” (Be Still My Soul from the Song Book of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (LDS) page # 124) 
 
As I sang those four lines at the opening of Sacrament meeting last Sunday, I was brought to tears and could not sing any further. I had been experiencing a lengthy struggle with the adversary over the last six months and that was the message I received from on high. 
 
This message is for everyone as Satan will tempt us with the weaknesses we know best in ourselves. Whether it is the feeling of worthlessness, running faster than we are able or beating ourselves up that we are not the best at everything, (whatever it is), this physical manifestation of our own weaknesses will drag us down to depression; the kind of depression that is debilitating and scarring. 
 
Satan wants us to lose.  He wants us to be unsuccessful especially in sharing and helping others in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Whether a single person, single parent, married parent, grandparent or aunt or uncle, we are righteous spiritual beings all working towards the same finish: to raise righteous children, do the Lord’s work on earth and help others.   
 
We know that our God will not leave us without a rope to climb or an open window to escape, we are His children and He loves us. An LDS priesthood leader, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf tells us: “Our destiny is not determined by the number of times we stumble but by the number of times we rise up, dust ourselves off, and move forward.” 
 
By the same token we are given weaknesses to be humbled and turn these same weaknesses to strengths. We read from the ancient prophet Ether who wrote: (Ether 12: 27-28) 
 
“And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them. 
 
Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all righteousness.” How can we forget these beautiful messages? When we are in the midst of our weaknesses or struggles, the task at hand can be so difficult that we forget the love of our Heavenly Father. We forget our purpose and how to fight back against Satan. We forget that we are strong and should not get sucked into a pity party for ourselves which leaves us depressed and useless.

A98,"SINGAPORE — A 26-year-old man was today (Sept 28) sentenced to two years and nine months’ jail for a series of offences he committed in 2013, including causing the death of his girlfriend when he lost control of his car and crashed into a tree. 

The crash also left Eric Leong Teck Wai wheelchair-bound. He was speeding along Hillview Avenue at about midnight on Oct 22, 2013 when he lost control of his car, causing it to swerve, mount the kerb and collide with a tree. 
  
Leong’s girlfriend, 23-year-old Cheryl Ng Hui Ling, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at the scene. 

The couple’s friends who had been sitting in the backseat escaped with fractures, despite one of the men being flung out of the car through the broken windscreen. 

In court today, it was revealed that Leong had been driving under the influence of drugs, including phenazepam, a sedative-hypnotic drug not available in Singapore. 

Some of the drug’s side effects include impaired balance, slurred speech, confusion, memory loss, and auditory and visual hallucinations. 

Deputy Public Prosecutor Houston Johannus told the court that Leong had been driving “recklessly, dangerously” at 20km/h over the speed limit, as if he was part of “a chariot racing competition”. The fact that Leong was driving under the influence of drugs is “a highly aggravating factor”. 

Pointing to Leong’s past convictions for driving without a licence and third-party insurance, DPP Johannus said it was clear that Leong had not learnt his lesson. 

In addressing Leong’s other charges, DPP Johannus again noted that the man had related past convictions. 

Leong was also facing one count of theft in dwelling, and another of procuring a teenage student to commit harassment on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender.

A99,"New TD Ameritrade Institutional Program Seeks to Help RIAs Spend More Time Serving Clients and Cultivating Prospects 

JERSEY CITY, N.J. -- (Business Wire) 

Time is a precious asset, yet registered investment advisors (“RIAs”) can lose countless hours to low-value work, disorganization or performing tasks they shouldn’t be doing in the first place. 

Avoiding time traps starts with advisors taking responsibility for how they spend their day. Personal time management and setting priorities are some of the key components of TD Ameritrade Institutional’s1 latest practice management program, Breakout GrowthTM: Driving Business Performance Through Efficiency, which shows how RIA firms can improve their top-line performance by focusing on efficiency. 

Running an efficient business starts with a clear, strategic vision and streamlining operations, but achieving meaningful productivity gains also requires better time management at an individual level by advisors and their teams. 

Tracking Time Traps 

As part of the Breakout Growth program, advisors track how much time they devote to different tasks for at least two weeks. Through this exercise, advisors can better understand how they actually spend their time and evaluate the results against the firm’s priorities and goals. 

When advisors scrutinize how they spend their days, they may find some of these common workplace time traps: 2 

Doing tasks that should be delegated 

Drop-in office visitors 

E-mail interruptions 

Paperwork 

Telephone interruptions 

Too much socializing 

And while incoming phone calls, client e-mails and business travel can’t always be avoided, many productivity-killers can be addressed by advisors improving their own work habits and personal organization: 

Confusion over job roles 

Inability to say “no” 

Leaving tasks unfinished 

Not using technology effectively 

Procrastination 

Trying to do too much 

Once an advisor identifies the sources of distraction, they can create a plan to make better time choices, focusing more of their day on high-value work, said Vanessa Oligino, director of Business Performance Solutions at TD Ameritrade Institutional. 

“You cannot totally eliminate distractions that arise in your daily life, but becoming more aware of what impacts your ability to accomplish your goals is the first step in changing your behavior and increasing your overall productivity,” Oligino said. “If people are frequently dropping in to your office and you have a hard time turning them away, for example, consider reserving specified hours for visitors.” 

Efficiency is the New Black 

Though working on “efficiency” may not be the most exciting task, TD Ameritrade Institutional believes doing more with less can be inspiring when you look at the numbers. 

Forward-thinking advisors whose business strategy includes a focus on efficiency, on average, experienced 2.2 times higher annual revenue growth and 46 percent greater owner-income per revenue-dollar than their peers.3 And though nearly half of RIA firms say efficiency is one of the most important growth drivers, three out of five business plans lack implementation details.3 

Through Breakout Growth: Driving Business Performance Through Efficiency, TD Ameritrade Institutional encourages RIA firms to look beyond growth objectives – such as increasing assets -- when making strategic plans. The program intends to show advisors how firms of any size can boost productivity by implementing problem-solving techniques, making better decisions about which tasks to delegate or outsource and making better use of technology tools. 

TD Ameritrade formally kicks off the 2015 campaign today, Sept. 24, with a webcast, “Building a Culture of Efficiency to Drive Your Business Forward,” featuring guest speaker Robert Miller of Arches Institute. 

Advisors can register to attend regional workshops that will explore the efficiency strategies of top firms. The first workshop takes place in New York, Oct. 6-7, followed by meetings in Atlanta, San Francisco and Chicago. TD Ameritrade clients also may access Breakout Growth content here, including a new perspective paper, “Running an Efficient Business,” that shows how improved efficiency fuels growth.

A100,"STEVE SMITH said the bouncer which caused England captain Eoin Morgan's concussion left several Australia players ""shaken"" having brought back memories of the fatal injury to Phillip Hughes. 
Morgan was dazed and unable to play any further part in the match after being struck on the helmet by a short ball from Mitchell Starc in the seventh over of the fifth ODI. 

Australia went on to win the match by eight wickets and the series 3-2. 

The England skipper was ""up and about"" by the end of the match according to coach Trevor Bayliss but he was deemed unable to take any part in the post-match ceremony. 

""He has got a bit of a lump and a headache and it is an anxious moment whenever anyone gets hit but the fact he walked off the field was a good sign. He was a bit dizzy for a while and it took an hour or so to come good."" 

Morgan was monitored by England medical staff after leaving the middle but Starc, who played in the match between New South Wales and South Australia in November last year which claimed Hughes, was clearly shaken up. 

Darren Lehmann saw fit to immediately walk around the boundary and talk to Starc and Smith admitted that a few of their number were affected. 

""I think there were a couple of guys that were a bit shaken up and Starcy in particular. Obviously it was a tough summer for us back home, losing a close mate. It's always nasty when you get a blow like that."" 

Smith added: ""Hopefully Eoin is OK."" 

Morgan has been hit three times on the helmet by Australian bouncers in the Royal London Series and Bayliss believes he may have to analyse his technique against the short ball.

A102,"click to enlargesnowflock/ThinkstockGood reporting lets readers draw their own conclusions, and that's a good thing.After reading Aimee Levitt’s Reader cover story on rape at the University of Chicago, I sent her a note to say how much I admired it. What followed was an exchange of e-mails that exposed differences of perspective rooted in age and sex. I wondered if Aimee was beginning to think I actually didn't like her story much at all. But the story's greatest virtue was that it didn't tell me what I had to think about it. Some writers put their heads down, snort, and charge the reader. If ambiguity gets in their way they trample it out. Although rape invites didacticism, Aimee didn’t do that. Other writers love ambiguity so much they refuse to sully it by coming to any point at all. Aimee didn’t do that either. She empathized with her characters’ traumas and struggles but she allowed them to be complicated and inconsistent. In our e-mails we sounded like two people arguing over mutual friends whom they both feel they’ve come to understand better than the friends understand themselves.
A journalist can’t afford to be an unreliable narrator, and Aimee’s reporting is meticulous. Yet she’s reticent. She gave me space. It’s the literary device of allowing the reader to write the story as he or she reads it. I saw this device at work a second time this week, in an essay in the Tribune. (It ran previously in the Washington Post.) ""I gave my daughter up for adoption. Then I tried to be her mom,"" is the title of the op-ed by Stephanie Andersen, a creative writing teacher in Pennsylvania who became pregnant at 16 and gave up the baby to a couple who couldn’t conceive. What we’re told: She stayed in touch with her daughter’s new parents, read their letters and studied their pictures. And when her daughter Eli was ten, Andersen welcomed her for a visit. These visits multiplied; when Andersen married, Eli was a junior bridesmaid. But when Andersen gave birth to a second daughter, Sophia, Eli’s disposition changed and she became sullen and angry. She announced she hated her family, and—Andersen tells us almost in passing—""after her mother moved out, she said she felt even more alone."" Eli actually moves in with Andersen when she turns 18. She enrolls in a local college, waits tables, and warms to Sophia. Andersen finally feels at peace. But it doesn’t last. Eli drops out of school and heads north to find her adoptive father. And now, Andersen admits to herself, ""I knew I would never be her mom, not in the way both of us hoped I could be. That chance, I understood now, had been lost 18 years ago."" She got to learn ""how to love her while simultaneously letting her go. Maybe that’s what motherhood is about after all.""
One way of responding to Andersen’s piece is to say she’s blind to her own material. But another way is to say she knows what she’s doing and she’s counting on readers to see past the story she says she’s telling to the ghastly story she hints at. Motherhood! an attentive reader is apt to think. This story isn't about motherhood. The real story here, the one we glimpse between the cracks, is about a little girl who grew up with two mothers who both abandoned her. She probably would have been better off if she’d never known her birth mother existed. Does Andersen understand that the boilerplate sentiments about motherhood she recites to wrap up her piece are vapid and off-point? Maybe not, but I want to think she does. As a final ironic flourish to a piece of ingenious creative writing they’re hard to top. I want to think that Andersen, like Aimee Levitt, knows her stuff and trusts her readers to find what's there."

A103,"Apperian a mobile applications management MAM firm from Boston announced a 12 million round today led by Malaysia-based First Floor Capital

Bessemer Venture Partners Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers North Bridge Venture Partners Intel Capital and CommonAngels Ventures also participated Today’s investment brings the total raised to date to just over 39 million dollars

This is the first time Apperian has sought funding since a modest 4 million round back in January 2013

Mobile Applications Management is a term for provisioning software developed in-house You could call it a private app store

Apperian actually started out as an enterprise mobile applications developer back in 2009 To give you some context of the market back then  while  By 2009 there probably weren’t a ton of enterprise customers looking for custom mobile applications except for the most experimental of the bunch

Yet Apperian endured and developed into an enterprise app store company when customers began asking for an alternative to launching their custom apps in public app stores from Apple and Google

While Apperian tends to compete with Mobile Device Management MDM vendors like AirWatch which was sold to VMware and Good Technology  the company differentiates itself from these vendors by allowing customers to deploy outside of an MDM system CEO Brian Day explained

The company believes this gives them a leg up with customers that want to deploy custom apps to partners consultants and other non-employees who would likely be reluctant to let these companies have access to their phones

While leading with an Asian investment company might seem out of the ordinary Day said his company went this route for a couple of reasons First of all it wanted favorable terms and valuation that wouldn’t require board-level involvement While the company wouldn’t disclose its valuation Day did indicate it was an up round from its previous investment announcements

Secondly First Floor gives the Boston company an in-road into Asia where it has very little presence right now While its development office is in Spain and that has helped build a presence in the EU so far Apperian has had only small deals in Asia It’s is hoping that by connecting with an Asian firm this will help gain entrée into this market

Since the last funding round the market seems to have caught up with Apperian Today it’s seeing much larger deals with the average deal size having doubled since the last round some on the high end with as many as 100000 users Day said

Customers include Aetna AT&T&comma; Emory Healthcare Reed Elsevier Toyota and Walgreens

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — A 30-year-old limousine belonging to the late Maya Angelou is being raffled off to raise money for children's therapeutic care. 
 
The Winston-Salem Journal reports (http://bit.ly/1Kn884r ) that an executor of Angelou's estate donated the custom 1985 Lincoln Town Car limo to The Children's Home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, a couple of months ago. 
 
Spokesman Norman Jameson says the child services agency wanted to convert the gray car into hope for children. It is selling 100 tickets for $100 each. Jameson calls that ""$10,000 for hope."" 
 
The vehicle comes with two chauffeur caps and a Wake Forest University parking pass, which Angelou used when she taught classes on campus. 
 
The celebrated writer and civil rights activist died last year at her home in Winston-Salem at age 86.

A105,"Stormy skies can be restful 
 
Warnings for : musings ( 1 ), mentions of vigorous exercise, and substitute swear words (“Cuss Lite”(TM) 
 
I have given up swearing for autumn, and taking up running til at least early December. It remains to seen which one proves more chuffin’ difficult. 
 
I’ve probably whinged before – and undoubtedly, unless WordPress shuts me down, or the world ends, will again – about the fact that new immigrants to the UK do not receive a handbook on arrival. Nor did the “Life in the UK” test cover such useful subjects as food, old telly shows, or swearing. 
 
“Life in the UK” did ( 2 ) include a section on sport, though it was comparatively brief compared to such useful bits of information as, “What percentage of the Welsh population are from ethnic minorities?” According to my husband, who’s a Yorkshireman, and helped me study, the real answer is, “All of them: they’re Welsh.” 
 
The citizenship exams are probably on my mind because a Polish lady we know has just sat her English exam, and is sitting her “Life” exam next. The subjects of immigration, refugees, and the like are also in the news and, judging from my own life, a heated topic of conversation. 
 
It’s also nearly five years since I officially became a British subject. I say “officially” because both practically and emotionally, I already thought of myself as Anglo-American. On a practical level, I had worked, paid taxes – including National Insurance (NI) – and did my best to follow laws and rules such as putting my bins out on the correct day. I’d also become involved in local causes, politics, and charities, as well as given money, and, quite literally, blood. 
 
Which brings me to my latest charitable venture, and the Shoes of Extreme Pinkness: 
 
See? 
 
So far, the shoes and several pairs of socks are the only kit which I’ve purchased for the fund raiser I’m running on Sunday 6 December: the 10k “Percy Pud” race in Sheffield . 
 
I do have one other bit of kit which I have been wearing whilst training: a t-shirt given to me by one of the two charities I’ll be raising funds for, Combat Stress . The other charity is also a mental health one, and is specifically round a project(s) aimed at helping people in my adopted home town of Doncaster. 
 
Because, whilst I’ll always be American – and tick the “ White, Other ” box on forms – I consider myself to be not only British in law, but by choice, and heart. 
 
Because, in part, I was allowed to make that choice. I was and am white, speak English , and am not – directly, at least ( 3 ) – perceived as belonging to a “scary” category of immigrant. 
 
Next time someone asks “But why don’t the such-and-such – fill in the blank with the ethnic and/or religious group of your choice – assimilate?” – ask yourselves: are we honestly giving people a real choice to join in?

A106,"Alpha-PVP in crystal form is known on the street as ""bath salts"" or flakka. It elicits delirium and hallucinogenic highs. These ""bath salts"" were seized in a different drug bust earlier this year. 
             
Wellington police are warning the psychoactive substances ban has resulted in more illicit drugs being ordered online and mailed to our shores after a series of synthetic cannabis busts at the border. 
 
Four people were arrested and charged with drugs importation, possession, cultivation and supply in the Hutt Valley and Porirua after a series of search warrants in those areas last week, police said. 
 
Wellington police and Customs had since intercepted drugs at the border, including Class-A drug methamphetamine, synthetic cannabinoid, Ecstasy, and Alpha PVP – also known as ""bath salts"" – as part of the investigation, they announced on Wednesday morning. 
 
In recent months the investigation, dubbed Operation Venus, had resulted in the seizure of dozens of small packages bound for addresses across the Wellington District.  
 
Detective Senior Sergeant Tim Leitch, head of the Wellington police organised crime team, warned the drugs-mail tactic appeared to be becoming common. 
 
""Since the increased restrictions of psychoactive substances in 2014 there has been an increase in the unlawful importation of these harmful substances,"" Leitch said. 
 
""People engaged in such activity cannot hide behind the apparent anonymity of the internet and face the real risk of criminal convictions and possible imprisonment for importing these substances."" 
 
Maurice O'Brien, Customs investigations manager, said border security detection systems were ""excellent"" and they aimed to keep drugs out of the country. 
 
The haul included ""bath salts"" – white or pink crystals composed of Alpha-PVP or Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone. 
 
It comes in crystal form, in tabs or $40 capsules. 
 
The drug is also known on the street as ""flakka"" or ""niff"". 
 
According to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, it can produce a state of ""excited delirium"" similar to a cocaine high, and characterised by hyper-stimulation, paranoia and hallucinations leading to violent aggression or injury. 
 
""Bath salts"" have been linked to aggressive behaviour and even deaths overseas. 
 
Jet skis, speed boats, a Harley-Davidson and two houses, together worth more than $1 million and  were impounded by Wellington Police after a bust targeting alleged Chinese imports of the drug earlier this year. 
 
Three men and a woman all aged in their 20s faced charges over the imports. 
 
Police said they are continuing to investigate the imports.

A107,"Business Insider/Aly Weisman   See Also      This chart shows exactly how insane Airbnb's growth has been over the past 5 years       The Craigslist 'Missed Connections' for Burning Man are just as absurd as you thought they'd be       What it's like to go to Burning Man with your 60-year-old dad      
 
A San Francisco couple got an unpleasant surprise on their way to Burning Man this year. 
 
As they were on their way to the annual arts festival in the Nevada desert , they received an email from one of their friends, thanking the couple for renting their apartment on Airbnb, The Guardian reports .  
 
But the couple hadn't actually put their apartment on the home-sharing site.  
 
Instead, they had hired a professional housesitter they'd found on the site TrustedHousesitters.com, who had then listed the apartment on Airbnb himself —   for a price of $2,000 for five days. 
 
""I feel violated, and pretty upset that somebody I thought I could trust has done this to me,"" one of the apartment owners told The Guardian's Jemima Kiss. ""He told our friends that there was a 'misunderstanding' between us, but there’s no way I told him he could go ahead and make $2,000 for himself."" 
 
TrustedHousesitters removed the offending (though entrepreneurial!) housesitter's profile from the site, and Airbnb banned that person's profile as well. The couple is also pursuing a civil lawsuit against the housesitter.  
 
""We have zero tolerance for this sort of fraudulent activity,"" Airbnb told Business Insider in a statement.  
 
TrustedHousesitter told The Guardian that because the couple didn't use its on-site messaging tool to reach out the the housesitter, it was harder to investigate the complaint beyond deleting the profile.   
 
The couple, for their part, said that next time they'll just recruit some friends to look after their apartment.

A108,"Growing up in small-town North Carolina, Resa Goldberg shared those Prince Charming-dreams of prepubescent girls everywhere, but when her prince arrived he came in a pickup truck, not a white horse, and rather than charming he was criminally abusive 
CHARLOTTE, NC, September 08, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- When your little-girl dreams for love are shattered by a shark in sheep's clothing, how can you escape him? Can you ever really get away from the terror and learn to trust yourself again? 

Resa Goldberg's provocative and, at times, painful new memoir, Love Me Madly (published by Moonshine Cove Publishing, LLC. ( www.moonshinecovepublishing.com ) introduces her as a starry-eyed teenybopper whose innocence is crushed by a series of horrifying sexual and physical assaults that spanned two years during high school. The book chronicles her journey from that harrowing trauma to divorced mom navigating the shoals of Internet dating. Somehow, and despite considerable evidence to the contrary, she never abandons her abiding belief that not only does Mr. Right exist, but that he's right around the corner---hidden somewhere in that Rogues Gallery of boys and men. 

The payoff at the end provides the author an understanding of the past--why she has made such bad choices, a way forward into a happier future and finally a mission to help girls and women who may have suffered similar experiences. 

At Goldberg's official book launch ( www.resagoldberg.com ) she donated a portion of her book sales to and organized a raffle for Safe Alliance, an organization that assists victims of sexual assault, teen pregnancy and domestic violence. On September 3, Mike Collins, host of WFAE's ""Charlotte Talks"" program (Charlotte's NPR affiliate) interviewed her about her experiences, what she has learned and how she is continuing to forge her relationship with Safe Alliance and speak out against violence against women. ( http://wfae.org/post/abuse-and-recovery-love-me-madly-memoir ). She was joined on ""Charlotte Talks"" by Licensed Professional Counselor Dr. Christopher McCarthy, co-creator of the Turnaround Anxiety Program and Blog ( www.turnaroundanxiety.com ). 

The story that inspired Love Me Madly: A Memoir has also been featured in The Charlotte Observer ( http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/books/reading-matters- ... 16263.html ), The Carolinas Weekly Newspapers ( http://thecharlotteweekly.com/arts_entertainment/2015/07/south-charlo ... es-memoir/ ) and Today's Charlotte Woman ( http://issuu.com/tcwmagazine/docs/tcw_aug_sept_2015/10?e=5554085/14448382 ). 

Resa has more than 20 years experience as a reporter, writer and editor for radio, television, newspapers and magazines and a master's degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Georgia. Her work has been published in both local and national publications, including The Business Journals, Pro, Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal and NASCAR Illustrated. She has helped launch three magazines in Charlotte, where she currently lives.

Hundreds of people from San Marcos and neighboring cities came to celebrate equality this past Saturday, September 12, in the form of a parade, marriage ceremonies and musical performances.

The festival doubled its attendance this year.

One of the main events took place on the San Marcos Park Plaza Stage, where a drag show was hosted by Gia De Flor and Chitah Daniels Kennedy.

The ladies performed an “Age of Aquarius” lip-synch and dancing performance.

San Marcos native Stephanie Austin says it’s been a long process to get the city to this point of acceptance.

“Growing up here, I never imagined that this would happen. I never imagined I would be performing in my hometown, like this. I mean, I knew what I wanted and I thought I would have to go to another place to do it. So, I had left because of that- but coming back and having all of this and the girls… It’s like a family really. But seeing it all come together- it’s so beautiful. There are no words to describe how amazing it all is.”

This year is especially important in history for LBGTQA history with the new federal gay marriage legislation, Austin said. The City of San Marcos and PRIDE came together to even incorporate a same-sex marriage ceremony into the PRIDE festivities.

“I think this year has been an amazing year for PRIDE all across our nation. I mean, we’ve had miraculous events happen throughout the last couple of months and pride month. And um, I was telling the girls I’ve been going to a lot of prides across the state and to see so much of it everywhere is such a beautiful thing, to see everyone coming together and finally accepting who we truly are and what we’ve always celebrated.”

It all began when Sylvia Sandoval, the woman who began this process more than 5 years ago, started to try and organize a gay-night at local bars called “Rainbow Night”. The event was a hit in the LBGTQA community, but no local bars were willing to consistently hold the event.

Luckily, on December 2nd of last year, that problem was solved with Stonewall Warehouse, San Marcos’ first gay bar. Now, they hold a drag show hosted by Gia De Flor the last saturday of every month.  De Flor, a Kyle native, says that the event is even drawing LGTBQA members from outside of the city.

“Being a college town, we’ve always had people, I guess 50/50 of people that support and people that don’t. I think in the last 10 years, we’ve seen more voices come out and join together and be more united. I think that welcomes in all of the bigger cities in the area for Texas State, being a college town. It’s just wonderful for them to get here and see that something that they’re familiar with is also happening here, as it should. There should be events for everyone everywhere, so it’s really good to see that.”

Another queen performing in the show, Tanta LaStyx, thinks the annual event is something to be proud of, saying San Marcos is more progressive than some of it’s neighbors.

“As a person who grew up in New Braunfels, Texas, which doesn’t have any type of gay community, it’s kind of amazing to see. I don’t know if you know this, but in the downtown of New Braunfels there’s a sign saying “Marriage is between one man and one woman” and that was only a couple months ago. Seeing that kind of irks me to the bone knowing i’m from there, so seeing something so close to New Braunfels on the total opposite makes me so happy. It feels good to be accepted especially in a place that you live, where you grew up. You don’t wanna look back on where you’re from and think “I live there…” you want to be proud of it and I am proud of San Marcos for stepping up its game.”

A110,"Ricky Church reports on the Heat 20th anniversary screening and Michael Mann Q&A at Toronto International Film Festival… 
 
One of the most groundbreaking crime dramas of its time, Heat celebrated its 20 th anniversary at the Toronto International Film Festival with a screening of the film in a new 35mm print followed by a Q&A session with the director himself, Michael Mann. 
 

 
This film was the first time ever legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starred together on the big screen. They had previously starred in The Godfather Part II together, but did not appear alongside each other due to De Niro’s role as Vito Corleone in flashbacks. Heat changes that by casting De Niro as a cool as ice thief and Pacino the obsessed cop determined to take him down. During the course of the film, these two characters discover they are not so different from each other, culminating in an epic shootout on the streets of downtown Los Angeles that forces De Niro’s thief to choose between his code of self-preservation and a new life. 
 
Before the film began, Michael Mann came out and introduced it with a few questions by the moderator. He talked about how this idea came to life from the true events of his friend, former police detective Chuck Adamson. Neil McCauley was based on a real life thief of the same name Adamson hunted down, yet talked to Mann about the mutual respect the two had for each other. He said “There was this wonderful duality about how Charlie thought it. And this guy was such a high-class professional thief, he was a great pro with a lot of discipline. His regard for the guy didn’t make Charlie hesitate for two seconds to hunt him down and eventually got into a shootout after a foiled robbery.” 
 
“It wasn’t a contradiction of two different ways of being and thinking at all. Both were true and 100%. One didn’t diminish the other and that became the idea of the film”. Indeed, both Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna, De Niro’s and Pacino’s respective characters, are protagonists of their own story and get an equal amount of time in the film. Mann continued later on that what really attracted him to Adamson’s story was “the notion that life is way more complex in reality than it is in my power to make up.” 
 

 
Mann also talked about the funny similarities between how a detective and director thinks. “They actually do the exact thing a director does. A director knows his characters, understands his characters motivations, expresses those in what the character may do in a certain scene. The detective shows up after a crime has occurred, sifts through what’s been left for them, tries to reconstruct the event, tries to then figure out the motive and locate the character. For the people who are really good at this, it becomes an addiction.” 
 
This is shown very well in the film as Pacino’s Hanna is completely taken over with his work. His marriage is facing its end because of Hanna’s refusal to open up about the dark side of his job with his wife, continuously letting it push him further away from a ‘normal’ life. Even Jon Voight’s character warns McCauley of this, noting that Hanna is on his third marriage and that only displays Hanna’s commitment to the job. Mann even admitted one of his favourite lines in Heat is when Hanna admits to his wife “All I am is who I’m going after”. 
 
After the film, Mann came back out for an extended Q&A session, opening questions up to the audience. It was clear that even 20 years after this film was released it is still a beloved film and considered a favourite among Mann’s fans. The first question was about the notion of time in this film, specifically the line “Time is luck”. Mann said “Time is luck is what I believe. Personally, I find Neil to be a very tragic, heartbreaking character and I feel his expectations on what he wants to have in his life are tragically cut short. Time is luck and that’s why I keep repeating it in all these movies.” 
 
He also explained where he got further inspiration for Heat and much of the imagery he used throughout the film and even some of his later films. Many fans of Heat probably know this story already, but Mann was very taken with a painting by Canadian painter Alex Colville depicting a man standing alone at a window, staring out into the ocean, with a gun sitting on the table behind him. This shot was used in an almost exact recreation as viewers see Neil McCauley coming home to an empty house, showing Neil’s life is bare of material things and human connection. “That was a profound sense of maintained, sustained alienation and loneliness. That’s how it affected me in the painting so I took great pains to recreate it.” 
 

 
He also recalled a funny anecdote of when they first found the Malibu house that would become McCauley’s home, the window was covered in seagull poop (Mann used a less polite way of saying it), but he wanted it kept as it added to McCauley’s isolation. The next day, someone had cleaned it off not knowing Mann wanted it kept. 
 
An interesting bit of history regarding this film was how, prior to 1995, it had been turned into a TV movie called L.A. Takedown . Mann had originally intended Adamson’s story to be a television series, following these characters over the course of a series. Mann revealed that he had written then script of Heat before L.A. Takedown , but used only about 40% of the script for the film. “I was interested in expanding all these characters and expanding their lives and imagined what it would be like over 22 hours.” After filming a pilot, NBC and Mann disagreed over certain aspects, so it premiered as a TV movie instead. Still keen to develop this project into a feature film Mann wisely kept ownership of the project and idea. He also admitted that it was “for the better” that this series did not make it to air. 
 
An intriguing discovery during this panel was what some fans consider their favourite scene in Heat to be. While many critics point to the coffee scene between Pacino and De Niro as not only the best scene in the film, but one of the best scene in any film period, many fans agreed the final scenes between the two actors at the airport was their favourite. It is hard to deny that scene is one of the best in Heat as Hanna and McCauley give a final acknowledgement of their mutual respect with Moby’s “God Moving Over the Face of the Waters” playing over it. 
 
Mann talked about the filming of this climax and how they were on location on the LAX runways to film the tense on foot chase. “It was fascinating because the plane were 250 feet over our heads. When they came through the ground shook and all the work we were all doing, myself, the actors, the crew, we were vibrating with the intensity of it. There’s something to be said for doing it for real. It’s not something you can do now, post-9/11.” 
 

 
Explaining further, Mann stated that he was trying to find “something that came from the ordinary, material world that we’re all familiar with, but yet is so depopulated of life that it feels like a transient stage or feeling. It had to be feel very industrial or real. Airports at night make me feel that way, particularly those zones where people never go. There’s nothing about those buildings or architecture that are made for people.” 
 
One of the final questions to be asked was about the shots and use of scenery. Heat is beautifully shot from start to finish with a lot of great scenery overlooking LA. For those who don’t know, Heat was filmed entirely on location with no sound stages at all, a process that is very costly and rarely done in today’s cinema. For instance, the epic firefight on the streets of LA was a somewhat difficult process as they could only film on weekends between certain hours. Heat also has, what may be considered today, a rather unconventional style of shooting where a scene ends on an object or out of focus. 
 
“At the time, I was very interested in negative space and asymmetrical compositions and things that would subjectify the experience of the film. That was the one imperative that I wanted to do to. I wanted, to the extent that I could, bring audiences subjectively into moments and scenes and characters. For me, it comes with knowing exactly what you want to do, not necessarily how you’re going to do it, but knowing exactly what you want to do in as much detail as I could get.” 
 
Mann concluded by saying “I think a lot of definition of moments in character comes from the anomalies so I started to look for what’s anomalous in a character’s behavior because that’s going to give him a lot of specificity of identity. I think audiences are way smarter than we know we are, perceptually we’re brilliant. I’ve always felt it’s my responsibility, my job, to use all these tools and constantly try to intensify the experience.” Asked to give an example of one these anomalies, Mann jokingly referred to Jon Voight’s hair and clothing in the film. 
 

 
Heat is, without a doubt, one of the best films in cinema and arguably Mann’s best. His friendly and thoughtful persona is evident as is his appreciation for fans of this film. What’s more is the amount of knowledge he has on filmmaking, character studies and letting his actors create spellbinding performances. Even if you’ve seen Heat a dozen times, pop it in your Blu-ray player right now and if you haven’t, you have no idea what you’ve been missing from Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and, most especially, Michael Mann.

A111,"The Walking Dead is more than just a zombie show. It's horror, true, but the AMC series is equal parts horror and dramatic thriller. Often times, the thrills originate despite the zombies. In a post-apocalyptic world not far removed from the one we know, the show doesn't ignore the perilous effect such an event would have on the human psyche. The main characters, led by Rick (Andrew Lincoln), are always in danger, externally and internally. The zombies are a constant threat; the humans they encounter can never be trusted; and, sometimes, even friends become foes. It's the versatility of the horror on The Walking Dead that makes it special. Zombie movies have been around a long time so the subject matter is nothing new. But Walking Dead fans know the scares can come from many places, like certain movies. Here are 10 films that either influence the show or use some of the same scare tactics. See them all if you can't get enough of following Rick and the gang around the post-apocalyptic wasteland. 1. Night of the Living Dead (1968) White Zombie, from 1932, is usually cited as the very first zombie movie ever made, but George Romero's Night of the Living Dead ushered the freaks into modernity. The image of the relentless undead flesh eater began here. The Walking Dead paid homage to Night, which is chiefly set inside a barn as the zombies try to get in, with its own claustrophobic episode set in a church. 2. Dawn of the Dead (1978) Romero's sequel to Night uses the familiar one setting formula (inside a mall) to thrilling effect but the film has more to say. The human survivors aren't mere victims, but reflections of humanity. Bad people still exist at the end of the world, and some of them even have time to rob, pillage, and steal. The Walking Dead doesn't forget this fact: People are still people, with zombies hunting them or not. 3. 28 Days Later (2002) The one film on this list most like The Walking Dead may be Danny Boyle's 2002 masterpiece 28 Days Later. It begins with a man in a hospital waking up to find the world as he knew it is gone (as TWD does) and it follows his journey through the madness. En route, he encounters friend and foe alike and Boyle uses breaks in the action to establish backstory and adhere us to the characters.  4. 28 Weeks Later (2007) The 28 Days Later sequel was one precursor for Fear the Walking Dead, the Walking Dead spin-off currently airing on AMC. It's a parallel movie, taking place in the same relative timeframe as 28 Days Later except in a different location and following different characters.  5. Dawn of the Dead (2004) Although The Walking Dead boasts little humor while trafficking exclusively in danger, you can still see thumbprints from Romero and from Zack Snyder, who directed the Dawn of the Dead remake in 2004. The remake features a great ""final girl"" in Sarah Polley's Ana Clark and a nightmarish ending that leaves the heroes still in peril. 6. Planet Terror (2007) There's nothing specific to link Robert Rodriguez's batshit grindhouse homage, Planet Terror, to The Walking Dead, apart from being a zombie movie. I just really like it. Well, maybe there is. Both have badass female characters with cool weapons: Cherry Darling with her machine gun leg, and Michonne, who wields twin samurai swords. 7. The Road Like The Walking Dead, The Road is a humorless post-apocalyptic odyssey with narrow focus. Based on Cormac McCarthy's Pulizer Prize-winning novel, The Road is the story of a man and his son as they do their best to survive a hellish new world.  8. Exit Humanity (2012) Set in the antebellum south, this lesser-known horror film is a hidden gem. It will remind you of The Walking Dead thanks to its forest setting and the hero's search for his son, which leads him into zombie hell (which has already claimed his wife). Plus, the zombies are awesome in this. 9. The Battery The Battery runs on humor as well as horror but Walking Dead fans will appreciate the amount of downtime that occurs when the world ends, zombies running amuck or not. It also focuses on the relationship between the two living characters, who can't seem to get along. We see plenty of that on The Walking Dead. Plus: amazing poster. 10. Deliverance The suspense classic of the '70s features zero zombies, but it's an outdoor adventure that never slows down. Plus, I'd rather meet a zombie than the disgusting backwoods psychos from this film. ""Squeal like a PIG!!"" No thanks, buddy. Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest"

A112,"Ernest Moniz, US Energy Secretary
The Energy Secretary for the United States, Ernest Moniz, thinks that the costs of producing solar and wind energy have fallen so low that they would be competitive with oil and gas even without the subsidies they currently receive from the government.
Moniz, who was trained as a nuclear physicist, explained to reporters that while the Obama administration is still in favor of the current push to extend renewable energy tax credits in Congress, there really is no need for them anymore.
Moniz’s belief comes from very real statistics that show the solar and wind market gaining momentum. At the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas, he backed up his ideas by citing rooftop solar panels, which could become as cheap as 6 cents per kilowatt hour in the near future. Wind energy is also falling in price, and electricity from wind farms is now cost-competitive with oil and gas.
The Wind Technologies Market Report from August 10 also demonstrates that wind energy is becoming extremely cheap, dropping nearly 5 cents per kilowatt hour in 2014. The report attributes this drop to “lower wind turbine price and installed project costs, along with improvements in expected [production capacity]”.
Of course, the oil and gas industry continued to receive subsidies from the government long after fossil fuel extraction became cheap, easy and nearly risk-free. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect solar and wind to get the same chance by way of federal assistance.

I have three incredibly horrible/wonderful children, and remind myself every single day how thankful I am for them. It’s because of them that I’ve come to know the real meaning of joy, true love, despair, fear, great pride and gratitude.  It’s also because of those three souls that I can’t regret the many years I spent in an unfortunate marriage.  (If I wasn’t still raw from the fact that someone who shall not be named managed to steal ½ of my TEACHER’S retirement, I might actually thank him for those children.)

Most of you are probably lucky enough to already know, but I’m going to share my own earth shattering realizations about what a real man in a grown-up relationship really does. First, a real man doesn’t play any crazy games. He doesn’t wait to call you, he doesn’t ignore your text messages or phone calls, and he makes you feel like you are the only and best partner in the world. He loves to hear your voice in the morning, and wants to hear it before he goes to sleep. He reminds you each day that you are important to him and that you are an important part of his life. Second, he’s honest. He tells you when you are wonderful, and when you are sounding a bit crazy. He tells you when you look beautiful and when you might want to donate that well-worn blue dress to the Goodwill.  He admires your children for their strengths, and gently reminds you when they make a misstep.  (Moms are a bit blind in some instances…it’s that maternal component that brings on an occasional bout of blindness.) Third, he makes it easy for YOU to be honest.  He listens to my boring stories, my silly fears and my occasional trips into the world of crazy ranting.  He never makes me feel like I should hide any of these sides of myself, and always has a response that makes me laugh.  Sometimes I think I share WAY TOO MUCH, but that’s because my heart is so at ease with this man.   And while I could go on and on,  do you know one of the best things of all about being in this particular grown-up relationship? (Well, besides the fact that I’m crazy about him…)   He’s decided that he needs to show me a world I’ve never seen before.  And when I say the world, I really mean it.

A118,"PC Rathband was shot and blinded with a sawn-off shotgun in July 2010 His widow Kath, 45, is set to marry prison guard John McGee next year Killer Raoul Moat had been released from prison just days before the attack Moat shot himself after a six-hour stand off with police while on the run    
The widow of PC David Rathband, who was shot and blinded by on-the-run killer Raoul Moat, is getting married again after finding new love with a prison guard. 

Kath Rathband, whose marriage to PC Rathband collapsed following the 2010 shooting, is set to marry her fiancée John McGee next year. 

The traffic officer took his own life in 2012, aged 44, unable to escape the depression brought on by his sudden blindness. 

But friends of Ms Rathband, 45, have expressed delight that she has found love again. 

   
 
Touching: Kath Rathband (pictured at the Colosseum in Rome), widow of tragic PC David Rathband, has found happiness with fiancee John McGee, who she will marry next year 
 
Relaxed: The happy couple were pictured relaxing on the sofa of Gogglebox stars Steph and Dom at their B&B 

‘Everyone is delighted for them,’ a friend told the Sunday People. 

‘She has endured a lot over the years. She deserves to enjoy life after all she’s been through. 

‘She’s so happy with John. He’s a top bloke, friendly, honest, trustworthy, everything she needs. All her friends and family are thrilled for them.’ 

The mother-of-two started dating Mr McGee in early 2013, and they have been living together for more than a year. 

Photos emerged of the happy couple in June, taken while they were on holiday in Rome and Kent. 

The holiday snaps prompted friends to ask if wedding bells were on the horizon, with one commenting on the Rome picture: ‘You married yet?!!!’  

But Ms Rathband replied: ‘We’re committed to not getting married.’ 

Other close friends of the pair expressed their joy at Mrs Rathband’s new-found happiness. 
    
Wedding bells: Friends were questioning in June whether they would get married, when a set of holiday snaps of the pair emerged on Facebook 

One friend wrote: ‘Ahh you look so good together.’ 

While another said: ‘The eyes have it. Proper smiley happy eyes.’  

One photo showed the couple lounging on Goggglebox stars Steph and Dom’s sofa at their B&B in Kent. 

PC Rathband was on duty in Newcastle when killer Moat shot him in the face with a sawn-off shotgun in July 2010. 

Moat hunted down his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and her boyfriend Chris Brown, 29, and shot them in cold blood using a shotgun two days after he was released from HMP Durham in 2010. 

Ms Stobbart survived the attack, while her ex-boyfriend went on the run and the next day shot and blinded PC Rathband. 
  
Tragedy: Killer Raoul Moat (left) shot and blinded PC David Rathband in a savage attack with a sawn-off shotgun in Newcastle 
   
Brave: The couple's marriage broke down following the shooting, as Mrs Rathband said they had underestimated the impact that the blinding would have on her husband 

Moat was hunted down by police and found in Rothbury, Northumberland, where he shot himself during a six-hour stand-off with armed police after a week on the run. 
 We knew that our lives were to change for ever, but we didn’t know how difficult it was going to be and the challenges that David would face.  Widow Kath Rathband  
PC Rathband spent nearly three weeks in hospital recovering from the attack, but was told that he would never see again. 

The officer became a national hero after the shooting, setting the The Blue Lamp Foundation to help emergency service workers who have been injured while doing their jobs. 

He was even honoured at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards in November 2010 for his bravery and charity work. 

But he was never able to escape the deep depression into which he sank after being shot. 

Speaking after the attack, Kath said: ‘He would see horrible things – children without faces and skeletons. He’d reach out to touch them. 

‘We knew that our lives were to change for ever, but we didn’t know how difficult it was going to be and the challenges that David would face. 
   
National hero: PC Rathband was honoured for his bravery and charity work following the shooting, after he set up The Blue Lamp Foundation to help injured emergency service workers 
   
Depression: But PC Rathband (pictured with an unidentified woman) was unable to escape the deep depression caused by his sudden blindness 

‘We didn’t know the impact it would have on him – psychologically, emotionally and physically.’ 

Mr Rathband moved out of the family home in August 2011 after it emerged he was having an affair with another woman. 

Although Ms Rathband had put up with previous affairs, his last, with 7/7 London bombing survivor Lisa French, effectively ended the marriage. 

Ms Rathband broke the news to her husband prior to him flying out for a holiday in Australia with his identical twin Darren. 

The former policeman grew desperate after the collapse of his marriage and struggled to cope with his irreversible disability, posting a series of tormented messages on Twitter. 
   
'First step': The inquest into PC Rathband's death found that the shooting was the trigger for the series of events that led up to his death 

‘Disaster. Job lost, eyes lost, family lost, wife and marriage lost, what a year.’ 

Another read: ‘RIP PC Rathband.’ 

Mr Rathband was found hanging at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, on February 29 2012. 

Coroner Eric Armstrong urged none of those involved to blame themselves. 

The inquest heard Mr Rathband had made threats to kill himself and told his new partner he attempted to hang himself but could not go through with it. 

But his widow Kath and police colleagues she alerted, while concerned for his well-being, did not consider him to be at immediate risk of suicide. 

The inquest found the shooting by Moat was the ‘first step’ in a series of events that led to his death.

A119,"Kris Lees is happy with the starting point for Protectionist and Lucia Valentina in the Saturday's Tramway Quality but the star pair's preparation still remain flexible in the Melbourne spring. Kris Lees is happy with the starting point for Protectionist and Lucia Valentina in Saturday's Tramway Quality at Randwick, but the star pair's preparation still remains flexible heading into the Melbourne spring. Melbourne Cup winner Protectionist is heading towards the first Tuesday in November ""whether it is through the Caulfield Cup or Herbert Power [Handicap] has to be decided"" after a couple of runs in Sydney, Lees said.

Lucia Valentina could earn her way to the Cox Plate if things go to plan. The mare returns in the same race as last year, where she dominated with an electrifying turn of foot on a wet track in a preparation in which she went on to win the Turnbull Stakes and finished third in the Caulfield Cup.

""She is probably not going to get the conditions she got last year but she is more mature and I'm very happy she is where she needs to be,"" Lees said. ""It is a tough race but she has shown in the past she can sprint well fresh.

""There are plenty of options for her in the spring and I think we are going to see a better mare this time, so we are no tying ourselves down. I haven't mapped out a preparation for her yet, but I think she is in for a big preparation the way she is going.""

The 1400m of the Tramway is short of the best distance for Protectionist but Lees believes he will have enough fitness to run competitively.

""We had a little setback with him, so the 1400m will suit him better than the Chelmsford Stakes. This will give him a good blow-out before he starts to step [up] in trip,"" Lees said. ""He is a stayer but I think he will be on their tails on Saturday. We just need to get a grounding for him to get out in journey.""

The pair are likely to be Lees' only runners at Randwick as Marple Miss and Oriental Lady will run in the features at Wyong on Friday.

The blinkers go onto Marple Miss as she drops back in distance, after being placed in town last start, in the Mona Lisa Stakes.

""We just thought the blinkers would sharpen her up as she steps up to black type. I think she could stretch out to a mile this time but she is still good enough from that draw [of five] to give that race a shake,"" Lees said.

Oriental Lady will take advantage of being the limit weight of 54kg in the Wyong Cup, where Lees will also have Slow Pace.

A121,"HYDE PARK, Vt. -- He came bearing bad news to a town set for solar. 

""We have to abandon the project,"" said Dave Hallquist, CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative. 

South Hero pledged support for a 15-acre, 1.5-megawatt solar project. But now VEC can't do it. A wetland at the site raised environmental concerns. 

Hallquist pitched another plan: a bigger, 50-acre project in a different location. VEC would partner with a big developer. 

  WCAX.COM Local Vermont News, Weather and Sports- 

""There are large solar developers who do a good job who can afford to take that kind of risk,"" he said. 

Hallquist is known for striking deals, a smart businessman at the forefront of innovative energy projects. He's a respected leader, pitching in when the lights go out. He's also the town moderator in Hyde Park. And now he wants to be known as someone else. 

""Christine Hallquist is who I really am,"" he said. 

Dave Hallquist is transgender-- basically born with a male body and a female mind. 

""I would never want to go to my grave knowing I didn't tell the world about this,"" he said. 

CBS affiliate WCAX in Vermont is sharing Hallquist's story. 

Dave says the need to finally live the truth stems from a dark place, a place of suffering. He was bullied and beaten as a child by classmates and by nuns, who he says demanded an exorcism on the eighth-grader because he was different from the other boys. 

""I learned early on that it would not be acceptable to be Christine,"" he said. 


Dave Hallquist is transgender. She is now going by Christine. 

CBS affiliate WCAX 


To survive, he toughened up, started playing sports and hid what was happening in his head. 

""I learned to the play the role well and I've been playing it ever since,"" Dave said. 

It worked. He fooled everyone in high school and college. And then he met Pat, the love of his life. The pair married two years later, though Dave kept the painful secret. 

""She's been amazingly supportive, but I'm not the person she married,"" he said. 

Several years after the wedding, Pat discovered Dave's hidden wardrobe of women's clothing. She was confused, confronted him and considered leaving. But eventually she chalked it up to a phase or a fetish, like cross-dressing just for fun, hoping it would pass. She stayed so long as no one else knew. 

""We were going to keep this secret to our grave,"" he said. 

She allowed Dave to dress as Christine in private. Christine usually did so while playing the piano-- alone. Pat didn't want to see it. Then came three kids: two girls and a boy. 

""It's incredibly painful not to be your authentic self,"" Dave said. 

""I don't believe at all that transgender men and women have mental illness as a result of being transgender,"" Dr. Rachel Inker said. 


Dave Hallquist with wife Pat. 

CBS affiliate WCAX 


Inker is a medical doctor running the transgender care clinic at Burlington's Community Health Center. Three-hundred trans patients have come here over the last 10 years, people in their late teens to senior citizens. 

""People will often talk about years as early as childhood of feeling that they are not in the body they were intended to, that people don't see who they are,"" Inker said. ""It can be a difficult process for people filled with loss, rejection, harassment."" 

Counting the transgender population is challenging. The U.S. Census Bureau doesn't ask if someone is trans and the number isn't tracked by the CDC. And not everyone is out. But experts working with the trans community in Vermont estimate the population to be around 1,400. That means for every 440 people you pass on the street, one of them identifies as transgender. 

""There's so much shame, a lifetime of shame, lifetime of embarrassment, a lifetime of trying,"" Dave said. 

After years of hiding, even thoughts of suicide and periodic purging, tossing out his women's clothes, Dave couldn't live like that any longer. 

""You try and you try and you try, and at some point you realize, I can't fight this,"" he said. 

About five years ago, he told his kids. 

""At first there's obvious personal shock,"" son Derek said. 

""This is a person we've been around for 30 years of my life... who is completely changing into a different person and that's hard, and recognizing it's hard. But we keep coming back to the fact that we really love each other,"" daughter Kiersten said. 


Dave Hallquist with family. 

CBS affiliate WCAX 


The family stuck together. And Derek is documenting his father's transformation. But they all admit it's been tough and still is, especially now that Dave's transition is further along. He's taking estrogen and testosterone blockers. He's changing and going public with his new identity. 

On one night -- a first outing for Christine with a group of trans women she met through the advocacy group Pride Center of Vermont. There's a new outfit for the occasion, makeup, hair and jewelry. And there's a bit of fashion advice from Pat, who's working to make peace with what's happening and still support the person she's loved for so long. 

No nerves, just excitement for Christine during the hourlong ride from her Hyde Park home to Splash on the Burlington waterfront. 

""I feel happy,"" she said. 

Quickly, Christine found new friendships. Drinks turned into dinner and an invite for two of Christine's kids to join. 

""In fact, I prefer being out and hanging with Christine now. Because I can tell she's happy,"" Derek said. 

But their hearts go out to their mom, Pat, back at home, who's struggling with the public revelation. 

""We all agreed we are super worried about mom,"" Derek said. 

The whole family is in group therapy. The marriage, though, is in question. 

""We are very lucky in that we have had each other in this,"" Kiersten said. 

Reporter Darren Perron: What's your biggest fear in coming out publicly? 


Kiersten and Derek Hallquist, Christine's children. 

CBS affiliate WCAX. 


Christine Hallquist: My biggest fear now is for my wife and family and how they adjust... When you've loved and lived with someone for 35 plus years, forgive me, I'm going to cry... I love my wife dearly. Of course this is a struggle for transgender folks. 

""Deciding to transition takes an enormous amount of courage. It is not something that people do impulsively. It's often many years of struggling with gender dysphoria, a depression and discomfort from a body that they don't feel like is their own,"" Inker said. 

""Now I've allowed myself to be who I really am,"" Christine said. 

Hormone therapy, surgeries to look more feminine or complete sexual reassignment surgery are options during transition. 

""Will I ever go all the way? I don't know,"" she said. 

Christine is not sure how far into her transition she'll go. 

""My brain believes I am a woman. I'm a woman. And I know that's really hard when you stare at someone like myself who has all the physical body parts of a man. You say, 'How can you be a woman? Get that out of your head! Get over it.' A lot of people say that. Sorry, I can't,"" Christine said. ""It's who I am. I can't get over this."" 

At 59, that once scared little boy is becoming the woman she hoped and prayed to be. 

Christine Hallquist: Now that it's no longer a secret, it's incredibly peaceful. 

Darren Perron: So will we see Dave Hallquist in a suit and tie again? 

Christine Hallquist: Unfortunately, yes. Ha. That's my costume... Do I see someday walking into the Legislature as a woman? Maybe. I'd love to see that day. 

Christine Hallquist has now informed her board of directors at Vermont Electric Co-op and her employees. And it's gone well. She no longer worries about losing her job. However, she is concerned about some national utility boards she sits on and whether she'll be squeezed out because she's transgender. 

She will send out a statewide press release Friday about her transition. And on Sunday, she will take part in Burlington's Pride Celebration as Christine.

A122,"KWAITO singer Masheleni is furious because his kids were taken away from his home without his permission! 

Masheleni, real name Sibongiseni Nxumalo, alleged: “My one-month-old and seven-year-old kids were forcefully taken away from my home in KZN by Ukhozi FM presenter Ngizwe Mchunu and his wife, Lindi.” 

Masheleni is married to Lindi’s younger sister, Namani. He claimed his kids were taken to have rituals performed that he did not believe in. 

“Before my younger child was born, they threatened that my wife would have a stillborn baby if we did not do rituals,” he said. 

“I am married to Lindi but I don’t know what her siblings do. I am very busy,” Ngizwe said. 

Lindi said she had not spoken to Masheleni for a year and she did not know why he was making such accusations. 

When he was asked why he didn’t lay a charge of kidnapping, Masheleni said it was because he was in Tshwane and the incident happened in KZN. His wife, Namani, alleged that Ngizwe and Lindi took her and the kids away from Masheleni’s home in Mbazwana, northern KZN. 

“They said mum was sick and I needed to come with them, but it was a lie. I am now staying at a friend’s house because I don’t think it’s safe to go home,” Namani said. 

“I do not know what my sister’s and brother-in-law’s plans are, but I will not let them perform a ritual on me or my children.” 

When the SunTeam visited Masheleni’s father, Joseph Nxumalo (54), he was furious. 

“I was not home when this happened, but Masheleni is keeping me updated. 

“I am still waiting for an explanation from my in-laws,” he said. 

A neighbour who did not want to be named said cops were seen forcefully taking Masheleni’s wife and kids away. 

Ngizwe told the SunTeam that he did not even know who Masheleni was.

“I was overseas. That person wants fame. You are just wasting your energy,” he said."
A123,"Tuesday, September 29, 2015, 12:29 a.m. – The Lord Jesus put in mind the song “Hear My Voice.” Speak, Lord, your words to my heart. I read Isaiah 37:23-27 (NASB). The Kiss (vv. 23-25) “Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! “Through your servants you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest. ‘I dug wells and drank waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.’ The Lord Jesus gave me a vision (illustration) early this morning of a man turning his back on his wife and, in front of her, giving his lover a big kiss on the lips. As I prayed concerning what this “Kiss” represents, I felt it was something political, like between heads of nations, so I looked it up. What I learned is that Leonid Brezhnev (Soviet Union/Russia) and Erich Honecker (East Germany) were photographed in a fraternal embrace (kiss) on October 7, 1979, as “a symbol of equality, fraternity and solidarity.” The photo was reproduced as a painting on the Berlin Wall in 1990 with the caption which read: “My God, help me to survive this deadly love affair.” “The socialist fraternal kiss or socialist fraternal embrace is a special form of greeting between the statesmen of Communist countries… When the two leaders considered themselves exceptionally close, the kisses were given on the mouth rather than on the cheeks” (Wikipedia). See also: http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/socialist-fraternal-kiss-leonid-brezhnev-erich-honecker-1979/. Although the news media likes to paint a picture of Obama and Putin at odds with each other, the Lord was giving me a picture of the two of them this morning as having participated with each other in this fraternal kiss, signifying solidarity in their communist beliefs and practices. These leaders are both part of the New World Order “beast,” and their goal is unified, which is to bring the world under the rule of this beast. Thus they have turned their backs on (abandoned, rejected) the people of their own nations and the people of this world. They are both part of the P5+1 (US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany) of the UN Security Council (New World Order “Sanhedrin”), which serves as the police force of the “beast” in forcing sovereign nations to comply with the New World Order, i.e. with this one-world communist regime, as well as to enforce a one-world religion which includes all people who reject the gospel of Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ as their Savior. Both leaders are in agreement with the method of rules of the New World Order, which the Lord also showed me as the head of a shadow prussianized army. Prussianized means, “authoritarian control and rigid discipline.” The face of this “authoritarian control” was that of Obama, i.e. he serves as the face of this shadow government (and military) which is controlling what goes on in the world from behind the scenes. He is one of their main voices (messengers) promoting and pushing this one world order and one world religion, along with Pope Francis. When he warned Putin that “dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world,” I believe he was making reference to this authoritarian control of the New World Order “beast” and its privatized military force which is lurking in the shadows, and which is a pervasive threat to the people of this world. Many times the Lord has given me a picture of this prussianized army as political spies, who could be members of our own families, neighbors, friends or people with whom we fellowship with in gatherings of the church. They work for the New World Order. They are against the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they are against those of us who hold to the truths of scripture, who teach Jesus Christ as the only way to heaven, and who preach repentance and submission (obedience) to God as part of the faith which saves us (See: Luke 9:23-25; Ac. 26:16-18; Ro. 6:1-23; 8:1-14; 2 Co. 5:15; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:17-24; Tit. 2:11-14; 1 Pet. 2:24-25; & 1 Jn. 1:5-9). And, they are plotting our demise. Their goal is to get the leaders of nations to divorce their own people and to marry the beast. The Congress of the USA has also “kissed” Obama, who is the face of this shadow government (New World Order), which is a communist, authoritarian regime which is taking over all nations and peoples and the church (institution). They have turned their backs on the American people in handing us over to this communist control of our nation. This “kiss” is just the beginning of this “deadly love affair” between heads of nations who have joined forces to bring the world under the submission of this beast (N.W.O.), and it will be disastrous for our nation and for the world – a very dark time in our history. Again, those of us who they consider “hard-liners” or “radicalized” or “extremists,” because we hold to the gospel of Jesus Christ, must be dealt with, to stop the spread of the gospel of salvation. Pope Francis is also another primary voice (face) of the New World Order who is going around the world preaching solidarity with this one-world government and religion and their goals. He, as well, has “kissed” this brotherhood of those who espouse communism. He, too, has turned his back on the people of the world. He, too, is a messenger for this “beast” and its plan to rule the world. News articles use such words to describe him as “masterful,” “fierce,” and “skillful” with a “softer style.” He has, and/or news articles about him have made reference to a “cultural war” or a “cultural revolution,” which the pope is promoting worldwide (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution). This revolution includes the persecution and killing of those who follow Jesus Christ and who preach the gospel. Pope Francis wants to do away with anything which divides the people of this world so that we all come together as one. His goal, too, is to have the leaders of nations divorce their people and marry the beast (New World Order). He wants all who profess the name of Christ to divorce Jesus and his gospel and to unite with the beast and his one-world government and religion (the synagogue of Satan). The real “climate change” he and others are talking about is this political climate change which is death to the old order of things so out of the ashes of the old order the phoenix (new order) can rise. When news stories mention the “international community,” they mean the “New World Order.” All this talk of global climate change is about change from the old world order to the new world order. The agreements they are trying to forge are those in which they get heads of nations to divorce their own people and marry the “beast.” Talks of “sustainable development” are really talks about this Cultural Revolution and getting people to conform to the N.W.O. There are many, many references to “unity,” “solidarity,” and “oneness,” in trying to get the people of the world to bow to the beast and to take its mark. They are forcing us to have to make a choice between the lives we now live (“business as usual”) and these transformed lives in cooperation and conformity to the “beast.” The “transition” they speak of is this transition from being married to “wife” to “lover.” This transformation involves changing our beliefs, values, behaviors, education, etc. This “alliance” they are trying to forge is this “kiss” of solidarity with the “beast.” So, be very discerning. It won’t be long before he roars his ugly head and the world is truly under his totalitarian rule. God Ordained It (vv. 26-27) “Have you not heard? Long ago I did it, From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps. “Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up. All this is in God’s plan to judge his adulterous church and the people of this sinful world. None of this takes God by surprise. Now he is bringing it to pass. The “beast” thinks he did this, and so he lifts his head high, but God reminds him that he is merely an instrument of judgment in God’s hands, to work God’s will, and when God is finished with them (the beast and his messengers), God will take care to judge them, as well. So, we can take comfort in knowing that God is absolutely in control of all that is going on, that he has a purpose for it, and that one day our persecutors will be dealt with. Yet, I believe scripture teaches that God’s purpose in judging his adulterous people is to revive their hearts and to restore them to proper fellowship with him, and to see many people come to faith in Jesus Christ before our Lord returns. As well, our Lord will never leave us or forsake us. He will carry us through this dark time if we put our faith and trust in him, and lean on his everlasting arms. Hear my Voice / An Original Work / July 9, 2012 Based off Psalm 27 The Lord is my great salvation. He’s the stronghold of my life. When my enemies attack me, My heart will not fear at all. Though a war break out against me, Confident in Christ I’ll be. Of the Lord, I ask that I may Live with Him eternally. Hear my voice, Lord, when I call you. Merciful to me You’ll be. Though my relatives forsake me, My Lord God will receive me. Teach me Your way, O my Jesus. Lead me in Your righteousness. I will sacrifice to my Lord. I will sing with joyfulness. I am confident that I will See the goodness of the Lord. All the richness of His blessings, My Lord has for me in store. He asks me to be of courage; To be strong and to take heart, Patiently as I wait for Him, And from Him to ne’er depart. https://vimeo.com/119813963"

Thus they have turned their backs on (abandoned, rejected) the people of their own nations and the people of this world. They are both part of the P5+1 (US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany) of the UN Security Council (New World Order “Sanhedrin”), which serves as the police force of the “beast” in forcing sovereign nations to comply with the New World Order, i.e. with this one-world communist regime, as well as to enforce a one-world religion which includes all people who reject the gospel of Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ as their Savior. Both leaders are in agreement with the method of rules of the New World Order, which the Lord also showed me as the head of a shadow prussianized army. Prussianized means, “authoritarian control and rigid discipline.” The face of this “authoritarian control” was that of Obama, i.e. he serves as the face of this shadow government (and military) which is controlling what goes on in the world from behind the scenes. He is one of their main voices (messengers) promoting and pushing this one world order and one world religion, along with Pope Francis. When he warned Putin that “dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world,” I believe he was making reference to this authoritarian control of the New World Order “beast” and its privatized military force which is lurking in the shadows, and which is a pervasive threat to the people of this world. Many times the Lord has given me a picture of this prussianized army as political spies, who could be members of our own families, neighbors, friends or people with whom we fellowship with in gatherings of the church. They work for the New World Order. They are against the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they are against those of us who hold to the truths of scripture, who teach Jesus Christ as the only way to heaven, and who preach repentance and submission (obedience) to God as part of the faith which saves us (See: Luke 9:23-25; Ac. 26:16-18; Ro. 6:1-23; 8:1-14; 2 Co. 5:15; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:17-24; Tit. 2:11-14; 1 Pet. 2:24-25; & 1 Jn. 1:5-9). And, they are plotting our demise. Their goal is to get the leaders of nations to divorce their own people and to marry the beast. The Congress of the USA has also “kissed” Obama, who is the face of this shadow government (New World Order), which is a communist, authoritarian regime which is taking over all nations and peoples and the church (institution). They have turned their backs on the American people in handing us over to this communist control of our nation. This “kiss” is just the beginning of this “deadly love affair” between heads of nations who have joined forces to bring the world under the submission of this beast (N.W.O.), and it will be disastrous for our nation and for the world – a very dark time in our history. Again, those of us who they consider “hard-liners” or “radicalized” or “extremists,” because we hold to the gospel of Jesus Christ, must be dealt with, to stop the spread of the gospel of salvation. Pope Francis is also another primary voice (face) of the New World Order who is going around the world preaching solidarity with this one-world government and religion and their goals. He, as well, has “kissed” this brotherhood of those who espouse communism. He, too, has turned his back on the people of the world. He, too, is a messenger for this “beast” and its plan to rule the world. News articles use such words to describe him as “masterful,” “fierce,” and “skillful” with a “softer style.” He has, and/or news articles about him have made reference to a “cultural war” or a “cultural revolution,” which the pope is promoting worldwide (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution). This revolution includes the persecution and killing of those who follow Jesus Christ and who preach the gospel. Pope Francis wants to do away with anything which divides the people of this world so that we all come together as one. His goal, too, is to have the leaders of nations divorce their people and marry the beast (New World Order). He wants all who profess the name of Christ to divorce Jesus and his gospel and to unite with the beast and his one-world government and religion (the synagogue of Satan). The real “climate change” he and others are talking about is this political climate change which is death to the old order of things so out of the ashes of the old order the phoenix (new order) can rise. When news stories mention the “international community,” they mean the “New World Order.” All this talk of global climate change is about change from the old world order to the new world order. The agreements they are trying to forge are those in which they get heads of nations to divorce their own people and marry the “beast.” Talks of “sustainable development” are really talks about this Cultural Revolution and getting people to conform to the N.W.O. There are many, many references to “unity,” “solidarity,” and “oneness,” in trying to get the people of the world to bow to the beast and to take its mark. They are forcing us to have to make a choice between the lives we now live (“business as usual”) and these transformed lives in cooperation and conformity to the “beast.” The “transition” they speak of is this transition from being married to “wife” to “lover.” This transformation involves changing our beliefs, values, behaviors, education, etc. This “alliance” they are trying to forge is this “kiss” of solidarity with the “beast.” So, be very discerning. It won’t be long before he roars his ugly head and the world is truly under his totalitarian rule. God Ordained It (vv. 26-27) “Have you not heard? Long ago I did it, From ancient times I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, That you should turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps. “Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength, They were dismayed and put to shame; They were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, As grass on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up. All this is in God’s plan to judge his adulterous church and the people of this sinful world. None of this takes God by surprise. Now he is bringing it to pass. The “beast” thinks he did this, and so he lifts his head high, but God reminds him that he is merely an instrument of judgment in God’s hands, to work God’s will, and when God is finished with them (the beast and his messengers), God will take care to judge them, as well. So, we can take comfort in knowing that God is absolutely in control of all that is going on, that he has a purpose for it, and that one day our persecutors will be dealt with. Yet, I believe scripture teaches that God’s purpose in judging his adulterous people is to revive their hearts and to restore them to proper fellowship with him, and to see many people come to faith in Jesus Christ before our Lord returns. As well, our Lord will never leave us or forsake us. He will carry us through this dark time if we put our faith and trust in him, and lean on his everlasting arms. Hear my Voice / An Original Work / July 9, 2012 Based off Psalm 27 The Lord is my great salvation. He’s the stronghold of my life. When my enemies attack me, My heart will not fear at all. Though a war break out against me, Confident in Christ I’ll be. Of the Lord, I ask that I may Live with Him eternally. Hear my voice, Lord, when I call you. Merciful to me You’ll be. Though my relatives forsake me, My Lord God will receive me. Teach me Your way, O my Jesus. Lead me in Your righteousness. I will sacrifice to my Lord. I will sing with joyfulness. I am confident that I will See the goodness of the Lord. All the richness of His blessings, My Lord has for me in store. He asks me to be of courage; To be strong and to take heart, Patiently as I wait for Him, And from Him to ne’er depart. https://vimeo.com/119813963"

“I was overseas. That person wants fame. You are just wasting your energy,” he said."
A123,"Tuesday, September 29, 2015, 12:29 a.m. – The Lord Jesus put in mind the song “Hear My Voice.” Speak, Lord, your words to my heart. I read Isaiah 37:23-27 (NASB). The Kiss (vv. 23-25) “Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice And haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! “Through your servants you have reproached the Lord, And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains, To the remotest parts of Lebanon; And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses. And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest. ‘I dug wells and drank waters, And with the sole of my feet I dried up All the rivers of Egypt.’ The Lord Jesus gave me a vision (illustration) early this morning of a man turning his back on his wife and, in front of her, giving his lover a big kiss on the lips. As I prayed concerning what this “Kiss” represents, I felt it was something political, like between heads of nations, so I looked it up. What I learned is that Leonid Brezhnev (Soviet Union/Russia) and Erich Honecker (East Germany) were photographed in a fraternal embrace (kiss) on October 7, 1979, as “a symbol of equality, fraternity and solidarity.” The photo was reproduced as a painting on the Berlin Wall in 1990 with the caption which read: “My God, help me to survive this deadly love affair.” “The socialist fraternal kiss or socialist fraternal embrace is a special form of greeting between the statesmen of Communist countries… When the two leaders considered themselves exceptionally close, the kisses were given on the mouth rather than on the cheeks” (Wikipedia).

A124,"Strictly Come Dancing's Jeremy Vine has told how he was left blushing after accidentally touching Kirsty Gallacher's breast during rehearsals. 
 
		 
The Radio 2 DJ is the new Strictly diarist for the Radio Times and in his first column for the magazine recalled his awkward encounter with the TV presenter while rehearsing the first group dance. 
  Jeremy Vine has told how he was left blushing after accidentally touching Kirsty Gallacher's breast on Strictly (BBC/PA)   
Vine revealed: ""At one point  my left hand flew out and landed on  Kirsty Gallacher's right breast, like  that moment with the Australian  woman in Fawlty Towers. 

			 
""She  gasped and I apologised. We've  put it behind us."" 



 
Meanwhile, fellow contestant Kellie Bright named and shamed her EastEnders co-star Danny Dyer as being a closet fake tan user. 

The 39-year-old actress, who plays Queen Vic landlady Linda Carter in the BBC show, revealed soap bosses had told her not to have a spray tan for the dance competition as it would interfere with filming continuity. 

But she said Dyer, who plays her on-screen husband Mick Carter, secretly wears it anyway. 

Bright said of having a professional spray tan: ""The EastEnders producers told  me I couldn't, but Danny Dyer  puts fake tan on every day! 

			 
""Sometimes he goes too far, so  I'll just match his mahogany head."" 

Former Strictly stars are set to discuss Life After Strictly at the Radio Times Festival this weekend. 

The full interview with this year's Strictly contestants appears in this week's Radio Times, on sale now.

A125,"CLINTON — Deanna Posey is adding to her coffee empire, expanding her drive-thru java station into a full-fledged cafe. 
  
It's a move the Clinton native has looked to do for several years, and finally she has found the perfect home for her perfect coffee shop. 
 
""I've had the double-sided drive-thru for 10 years and have always wanted to expand, but I've never been able to find the right spot,"" Posey said. ""I wasn't really in any big hurry, and I've always wanted a spot in this part of town because it just continues to grow, so when it opened up I knew it was time."" 
 
The part of town Posey now calls home is in the 13th Avenue North corridor, which has seen its fair share of growth in the past five years, including retail as well as food and beverage establishments. 
 
It's exactly the environment she wanted for her first store front, and she is optimistic for what it will bring to the area. She is also making some new friends and business parterners with the upgraded location, including her new neighbor, Slop's Food and Spirits. 
 
Since opening Aug. 5, Posey and Slop's owner Josh Christiansen have developed a business partnership that allows patrons of both establishments to receive the services offered at each, a sort of ""best of both worlds"" approach. 
 
""There's a lot going on for both of us so we decided to do a partnership where people can come here for breakfast and then are able to order lunch from over there if they want,"" Posey said. ""I think it's going to be a great partnership and something unique to offer to people."" 
 
While Deanna's Java Cafe offers the standard baked goods as the java station, one special item Posey has added to the menu at the new location is a waffle bar. The bar features a variety of toppings including chocolate syrup, chocolate chips and marshmallows and so far has been a big hit among Posey's loyal clientel. 
 
It's an effort she has implemented to not only satisfy her ongoing customer base, but is an attempt to encourage new customers to try out her shop. 
 
With the drive-thru station, Posey has already reached a significant customer base, one that has embraced her new cafe setting, and one she hopes will take advanatge of the atmosphere she has created in the coffee shop. 
 
""There is a genre of all different age groups that come to my shop and I wanted to embrace all of them,"" Posey said. ""I wanted a different atmosphere that would feel welcoming to everyone."" 
 
So far, in just a short time of operation Posey has already accomplished that with her customers, some who feel the establishment is a must-needed addition to the 13th Avenue North corridor. 
 
What she hopes is that will continue, and Deanna's Java Cafe will become a neighborhood staple, an environment for everybody and more than anything, something she can be proud of. 
 
""When I started the drive-thru it was because I wanted to work for myself, to do something postive and fun,"" Posey said. ""We've had such a good time already; I feel like it's only going to get better.""

A127,"U.S. District Judge David Bunning has issued an order saying Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis will be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshal's Office after nearly a week in custody. 
  
The order, filed today, says Davis shall not interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, with the efforts of her deputy clerks to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples. 
 
Originally jailed and held in contempt for refusing to comply with court orders, Davis has since been lodged in the Carter County Detention Center since last Thursday. 
 
The official order reads: 
 ""Defendant Davis shall be released from the custody of the U.S. Marshal forthwith. Defendant Davis shall not interfere in any way, directly or indirectly, with the efforts of her deputy clerks to issue marriage licenses to all legally eligible couples. If Defendant Davis should interfere in any way with their issuance, that will be considered a violation of this Order and appropriate sanctions will be considered.""  
A status hearing has been set for this Thursday and this order makes it unclear as to what Bunning's next action will be. 
 
However, “appropriate sanctions” will be considered if Davis does not comply, Bunning said. 
 
The judge has also ordered court-appointed lawyers for the deputies to report every 14 days on their compliance. 
 
According to reports ,  Davis' lawyers did not immediately respond to questions about whether she will comply with the order.

A128,"Kirsten Dunst has picked out a name for their future child. 

And it seems Garrett Hedlund is on the same wavelength as his girlfriend of three-and-a-half years. 

The actor was spotted unloading baby supplies outside the couple's Los Angeles home on Saturday. 

Carting a vintage-style wooden high chair, a Pack-n-Play crib and an umbrella stroller inside, all they need now is a baby. 
   
Baby on the brain? Garrett Hedlung was spotted unloading baby supplies outside his and Kirsten Dunst's Los Angeles home on Saturday 
   
Everything but the baby: The actor appeared to be prepping to host friends over the Labour Day weekend 

And while it appeared Garrett was simply getting the house ready to host friends for the Labour Day Weekend, it surely won't be long until he's prepping for his own child. 

'I'm in baby mode because two of my really good friends are pregnant right now,' his long-term love told Red magazine last year. 

'One of them is pretty chilled and the other's like, ""I can't wait to have a glass of wine!"" 

'I love it though. We've already picked her girl's name, it's done! I think 33 is a good age to have your first baby.' 
   
His turn next: Garrett's long-term love has made no secret of the couple's desire to start a family 
   
Picked out a name: Kirsten, 33, said she was the right age to start a family 

The blonde beauty, who turned 33 in April, has been dating Garrett since October 2011. 

But before they start a family the couple are said to have one more thing to organise - their wedding. 

Indeed just this week Star magazine said that the 32-year-old Tron star had popped the question to his 33-year-old girlfriend. 

An insider insisted the couple threw a party 'for 50 of their closest friends and family at their home in LA' to celebrate the news. 
   
Dashing duo: Garrett and Kirsten, seen here in November, are reported to be engaged 
   
Not so fast: Though a rep for the actor denied Star's engagement story, an insider confirmed that the couple was 'throwing a party for 50 of their closest friends and family at their home in LA' to celebrate the news; here they are seen in October  

According to the source, the Bring It On starlet 'already calls him her husband.' The wedding will take place sometime in 2016, according to the weekly. 

His rep denied the story to the magazine. 

It was also alleged that the two are interested in starting a family down the line. 

'They've hinted that they're ready to become parents,' said the pal. 

'If all goes according to plan, by this time next year they'll be married and Kirsten will be pregnant!' 

In December UsWeekly also reported the Unbroken star was gearing up to ask Dunst for her hand in marriage. 
   
Wide awake: The two met on the set of On The Road  in 2012; here Dunst is seen in a scene from the film 

The two met on the set of On the Road back in 2012 and have been inseparable ever since. 

Their relationship apparently started out with a rocky first date involving a canoe and a stagnant pond. 

Garrett later fondly recalled, 'I took her out on a 3am canoe ride. It was not a stable canoe. We fell out and had to swim back in mucky, sh***y water, like golf-pond water.'  
   
Cruisin': The 32-year-old Hedlund played two characters in the hit film that also starred Kristen Stewart 

Dunst is perhaps best known for her role opposite Tobey Maguire in 2002's record-setting blockbuster Spider-Man. 

She dated several leading hunks including Jake Gyllenhaal and Adam Brody before meeting Garrett on the set of On The Road. 

Hedlund dated Leighton Meester, who he met on the set of the 2010 drama Country Strong, which also starred Gwyneth Paltrow.

A129,"_ TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 09/21/15 -- Torex Gold Resources Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Torex"") (TSX: TXG) is pleased to announce that its 100% owned subsidiary Minera Media Luna, S.A. de C.V. (""MML"") has signed a letter of intent (""LOI"") with the Ministry of Public Safety of the State Government of Guerrero (the ""Ministry""), endorsed by the Federal Government, for the provision of permanent police presence in the areas adjacent to the Company's Morelos Gold Property in southwest Mexico. 

Fred Stanford, President and CEO of Torex stated: ""Our team has been working collaboratively with the Mexican State and Federal Governments to establish a long-term program to provide security to the communities in and around our El Limon-Guajes (ELG) Mine and the Media Luna Project. This letter of intent is the first step in establishing a pilot program between the government and the private sector to provide security conditions that are conducive to economic development and social stability in the area."" 

In the first stage of the pilot program, the Ministry will establish three check points with permanent police presence which, along with regular patrols, will control access to the communities in the areas adjacent to our ELG Mine. The Media Luna Project, will receive some security benefits from this pilot program, with more comprehensive coverage planned for later programs. MML will support the program with infrastructure including lodging for the police force, and goods and services in the form of transportation and vehicle maintenance. The program will come into effect immediately upon settling and signing a formal agreement on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the parties and may be renewed on a yearly basis by agreement of the parties. It is the vision of the program to extend its influence to the entire Guerrero Gold Belt in the future through similar agreements with other mining companies operating in Guerrero. 

Torex is a growth-oriented, Canadian-based resource company engaged in the exploration and development of its 100% owned Morelos Gold Property, an area of 29,000 hectares in the highly prospective Guerrero Gold Belt located 180 kilometers southwest of Mexico City. Within this property, Torex has two projects: the El Limon-Guajes (ELG) Mine, currently under development, and the Media Luna Project, at an advanced stage of exploration. Torex intends to identify a pipeline of future economic deposits within its property, which remains 75% unexplored.

A130,"LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — A Kentucky county clerk has appealed a judge’s decision to put her in jail for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. 
 
This Thursday, Aug. 3, 2015 photo made available by the Carter County Detention Center shows Kim Davis. The Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk went to jail Thursday for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, but five of her deputies agreed to comply with the law, ending a two-month standoff. (Image source: Carter County Detention Center via AP) 
 
Attorneys for Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis officially appealed the ruling on Sunday. The three-page motion does not include arguments as to why Davis should be released but amends Davis’ earlier appeal of the judge’s order. 
 
Davis objects to same-sex marriage for religious reasons and stopped issuing all marriage licenses in June after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. Two gay couples sued her. U.S. District Judge David Bunning ordered Davis to issue the licenses but she refused to do it saying she could not betray her conscience. 
 
Bunning sent Davis to jail on Thursday for disobeying his order. Her deputy clerks then issued marriage licenses to gay couples Friday.

			Posted:  Monday, September 7, 2015, 11:28 PM    
 
By Larry Fine 
 
NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Andy Murray fell out of the U.S. Open under a barrage of aces and service winners off the racquet of towering South African Kevin Anderson in a match that ended two grand slam streaks. 
 
Anderson reached his first grand-slam quarter-finals with a 7-6(5)6-3 6-7(2) 7-6(0) victory at Louis Armstrong Stadium after a string of seven losses in fourth round matches at grand slams. 
 
Murray's loss snapped the Briton's run of having reached 18 consecutive grand slam quarter-finals. 
   
""That's obviously something that is disappointing to lose,"" said the third-seeded Scot, who smashed his racquet in frustration after losing the second set. ""That's many years' work that's gone into building that sort of consistency. 
 
""Also to lose a match like that, that was over four hours, tough obviously after a couple of tough matches earlier in the tournament, as well. It's a hard one to lose, for sure."" 
 
The defeat came at Louis Armstrong Stadium, the U.S. National Tennis Center's second court. 
 
""That court is a lot quicker than Ashe. I felt like I was on the back foot quite a lot. Wasn't able to play that offensively,"" said Murray. 
 
""But when you're playing against someone that has the game style that he does, you're always going to have to do a fair bit of defending, especially if he serves well."" 
 
Murray lamented some lost chances against the 6-foot-8 (2.03m) South African, seeded 15th. 
 
""When you're playing against players that are at that level, you need to make them think and then give them a chance to get nervous,"" he said about how the match might have gone differently had he cashed in a couple of break points. 
 
""I felt like I had my opportunities there but didn't manage to capitalize on them."" 
 
Murray, who has struggled with a head cold in the past week and battled back to victory in the second round from two sets down, did not blame fatigue. 
 
""I was able to fight as I wanted to through to the end of the match. So I don't think the amount of tennis I played played a part.

A132,"GRAYSON, Ky. — County clerk Kim Davis was released from jail today, five days after a federal judge locked her up for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. 
 
U.S. District Judge David Bunning lifted the contempt order against Davis, saying he was satisfied that her deputies were fulfilling their obligation to grant licenses to same-sex couples in her absence. But he warned Davis not to interfere. 
 
“She’s a free woman,” Carter County jailer R.W. Boggs told Reuters. 
 
A crowd of dozens of sign-carrying, flag-waving supporters who had gathered on the jailhouse lawn for what they called a rally for religious freedom swelled to hundreds as the news of the judge’s action spread. Supporters handed out white crosses, sang “Amazing Grace” “God Bless America” and chanted, “Let Kim go!” 
 
The move came down just before Davis received jailhouse visits from Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz. They were ushered into the building shortly after the judge’s order was issued, as was Davis’ husband, Joe Davis. 
 
Davis was put in jail on Thursday for the boldest act of resistance by a public official yet to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that effectively legalized gay marriage across the nation. 
 
The timing of her release order came as something of a surprise. Last week, Bunning said that he might reconsider his decision to jail her in a week. 
 
Citing “God’s authority,” Davis, an Apostolic Christian, stopped issuing marriage licenses in June after the Supreme Court said gay couples have a constitutional right to marry anywhere in the U.S. 
 
Two gay couples and two heterosexual ones sued her. Bunning ordered Davis to issue the licenses, and the Supreme Court upheld his ruling. But she still refused, and was held in contempt of court and hauled off to jail in handcuffs, igniting protests from members of the religious right. 
 
They have rallied for days outside her office, at the jail, even outside the judge’s home. 
 
Five of Davis’ six deputy clerks — all except her son, Nathan Davis — agreed to issue licenses to gay couples with Davis behind bars. In lifting the contempt order, Bunning asked for updates on the five clerks’ compliance every two weeks. 
 
Davis’ jailing has offered some of the many GOP presidential candidates an opportunity to appeal to the party’s evangelical Christian wing, which opposes gay marriage and casts Davis’ imprisonment as an issue of religious freedom. 
 
Some observers viewed the candidates’ visit to the jailhouse with skepticism, dismissing it as mere political posturing for two low-level candidates. 
 
“Politicians have latched onto the cause of the day for as long as there have been politicians,” said Sam Marcosson, a constitutional law professor at the University of Louisville, who has dismissed claims that religious liberty should exempt Davis from issuing licenses. 
 
“It will do nothing whatsoever for getting Kim Davis out of jail for Mike Huckabee to appear at a rally today. But it will certainly keep the temperature hot, and it brings attention to Mike Huckabee.” 
 
On Monday, Davis’ lawyers took their case to a federal appeals court, asking that Davis be allowed to remove her name and title from marriage certificates issued in Rowan County so that she would not have to act against her conscience. 
 
Casey County Clerk Casey Davis, who recently finished riding a bike more than 400 miles across the state of Kentucky in solidarity with Kim Davis, said he was relieved she was being released. He is not related to her. 
 
“It’s been a total injustice for her being there to begin with,” he said. 
 
But he said he is still not issuing any marriage licenses, and suspects the conflict could come to his county next. He said only one same-sex couple has inquired about a marriage license in his county and was told there were no licenses being issued, and that’s the last Davis heard from them.

Or, more especially, in the words of Steve Evans, it’s proud manager and chairman, with the Millers enduring their toughest time since Tony Stewart made the judicious decision to appoint the Scot in April, 2012.

Back-to-back promotions and preserving their Championship status represents impeccable form in the course of three progressive campaigns. 

But in the oscillating knee-jerk world of football where the memory span of many supporters is shorter than it has ever been regarding results, the Millers, in the view of Evans, are now facing a chargesheet.

They head into this afternoon’s Championship home game with Cardiff City without a league win this term along with three other Football League sides – Blackburn Rovers, Crewe Alexandra and Newport County – and propping up their division.

The Millers’ disappointing sequence has led some fans to start openly questioning Evans, but with the season still in its relative infancy and armed with the benefit of the history of the past few seasons when the club has held its nerve in tense times, the 52-year-old is bullish regarding the prospect of a fightback.

As in the words of the famous Tubthumping song from Chumbawamba, if you knock Evans down, he will get up again, while vowing that Rotherham United will continue to prove a ‘beacon of light’ for the derided South Yorkshire town.

Offering trademark defiance, manager Evans said: “We are almost in a courtroom situation, where Tony Stewart and Steve Evans are in the dock getting judged by the jury and the jury is our supporters. 

“If the evidence had been judged halfway through League Two and League One, me and Tony would have been sent down. If it had been this January, it is fair to say we’d be down again. 

“But, as the chairman said, there’s a lot of evidence to come out of Rotherham United.

“After six or seven games to be saying this and that is disrespectful to what we have achieved in three-and-a-half-years really. 

“We sit here four points behind half the league and yet we don’t know what we are doing. We have got little points to prove.

“Don’t people think Steve Evans and Tony Stewart aren’t fighters and haven’t got pride and determination? 

“Do they think if we get down, we don’t get back up again? We are the leaders of that in Rotherham United. 

“Our club has been the only beacon of light in Rotherham for three-and-a-half years. That beacon of light is not going to go out, that’s for sure.”

Evans is the first to acknowledge that the Millers’ start has been far from what everyone associated with the club hoped for, but equally, he believes that his side remain just fine margins away from removing the winless Championship millstone from their backs in 2015-16.

Two sound enough away shows at Charlton and Brighton, without a surfeit of points, justify that assumption, with Evans mindful of how the restorative benefits of one win can change the Championship complexion entirely.

He said: “Sometimes you read things that annoy you a bit. I have read that a couple of clubs have made great and steady starts and they are three points in front of us. 

“One report I read said ours is a shocking start and it’s only three points behind one who have had a steady start...

“You set objectives at the start of the season. The first clean sheet, goal and point we have. We just need to get our first win to get off and running. You have to dig in and be determined.

“The large majority of supporters – and I meet many on a daily basis – speak about the remarkable progress we have made. 

“But we don’t want it to be for nothing and don’t want to be back in the same league as Sheffield United and Doncaster Rovers and Chesterfield. We don’t want to be in League One and must do what we can to stay in this Championship.”

Evans’s stock-in trade is winning and he prides himself on possessing that winning mentality, with those traits manifested not just at Rotherham, but also earlier in his managerial career. 

If it means making a few enemies on the way, so be it.

Given his side’s recent dearth, the Millers chief is ravenous in his desire to reacquaint himself with that winning feeling which all his week’s work strives towards – with the ‘supporter’ in him also understanding fans’ craving for that sensation, too, and what they expect as a bare minimum if that does not happen. 

He added: “The majority of supporters are with us every step of the way and I want to win matches more than anyone in the world. I want to get back to that winning feeling. 

“I read some quotes attributed to Jose Mourinho this week and he says he’d forgotten what it felt like to win until he won in the Champions League. That is what it feels like as a manager.

“But if you are a football supporter, you want to win matches. I can relate to that as I am a supporter of Glasgow Celtic. 

“And if I turn up to games, I don’t care if we are playing Real Madrid or Barcelona, Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea; I want my team to compete. 

“That’s what our supporters demand. They can accept if we lose if we have a go as they are honest and genuine people. 

“And in the first two or three games at home, they probably feel we haven’t had a go. And I can understand that.

A134,"A LUXURY wedding venue has been forced to use silent fireworks after a particularly noisy display caused a dog to have a seizure and sent debris flying into neighbouring gardens. 
The £6,000 gardens at Kilver Court in Somerset offer couples ""the perfect countryside setting for wedding receptions and civil ceremonies"". 

But guests will now only be allowed to have pyrotechnics if they make no noise after a handful of complaints from locals. 

Horrified resident Kayley Ashman said: ""They were very loud and the remains were landing in my aunty's garden. 

""Thank god they missed the hot tub."" 

Meanwhile Josephine West, who called the police following the display, said: ""I'm so glad they have pulled their finger out, it was totally out of order. 

""The debris from the shells that hit my house, car and lorry were big. Let alone the seizure it caused my dog to have."" 

But numerous locals have jumped to the defence of the venue - arguing that the fireworks are popular in the town and should not be scrapped. 

Peter Stratford said: ""It would appear again that the minority voices of several people has once again been taken into account resulting in this knee jerk reaction. 

""The vast majority of people who do not feel the need to resort to social media would not appear to be concerned by the displays."" 

Wayne Frapple also jumped to Kilver Court's defence. 

He said: ""Pretty sad when people can't choose to celebrate their special day whether it's a wedding, birthday or anything else the way they want. 

""Who celebrates with silent fireworks?"" 

A spokeswoman for the venue said: ""Kilver Court acted in the best interest after an exceptionally loud firework display. 

""It was very loud and so we quickly acted to prevent that from happening again.""

A135,"Katinka Blackford Newman, 47, was prescribed antidepressants Quickly became psychotic, believing she had killed her children on live TV Spent the year in a near-catatonic state taking a cascade of powerful drugs She only recovered when she stopped taking all medication   
Divorce is never easy, but when Katinka Blackford Newman separated from her lawyer husband in January 2012, after 13 years of marriage, friends couldn't believe how well she coped. 'I got fit and I started dating,' she says. 

A successful film-maker with a raft of award-winning documentaries behind her, including Locked Up Abroad, Katinka was, she says, 'on top of my game'. 

'I'd always juggled my career with running a household,' she explains. 'I thought nothing of directing crews of 50, yet always found time to attend school functions and throw dinner parties.' 
   
Katinka Blackford Newman, 47, with daughter Lily, 14, right, and her son Oscar, 12, left 

But nine months after she and her husband separated, she was faced with an emotional crisis she couldn't solve - the sale of the family home. 

'I felt I'd let the kids down - Oscar was then ten and Lily 11 - and I was crippled by fear of the unknown,' she says. 

Suffering from sleepless nights, and waking in pools of sweat - at 47 she was beginning to suffer from hot flushes associated with the menopause - she made an appointment with a private psychiatrist, who concluded she was suffering from depression. 'The world I had built was crumbling - but looking back, I don't think I was ever depressed,' she says. 
 
Nonetheless, the psychiatrist prescribed an antidepressant, escitalopram, one of a group of widely prescribed drugs called SSRIs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which effectively boost levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain. 

Hours after taking the first dose, Katinka felt restless and agitated, as if she needed to be in constant motion. She didn't sleep that night and, by the following day, wasn't making any sense. 

'I had this overwhelming feeling of doom,' she says. 'I thought I was living inside a video game - at one point I was 100 per cent certain I'd killed the children - and I'd been filmed killing them for national TV. I thought the police were outside waiting for me.' 

In fact, Katinka had taken a kitchen knife and lacerated the whole of her left arm. 'I was in hell,' she says. 'It was terrifying.' 
   
Katinka was prescribed a cascade of powerful drugs to treat her symptoms 

Frightened, the children called their aunt and uncle. As Katinka had private health insurance, her sister drove her to a leading private hospital in London, where she was sedated. 

Katinka was diagnosed with psychotic depression and started on an anti-psychotic drug, risperidone, and another antidepressant, mirtazapine, which immediately made her feel lethargic, spaced out and very anxious. 

'I dribbled and I was monosyllabic,' she says. 'There also were numerous ""talking therapy"" sessions, but I couldn't sit still to listen. I didn't react when the children came to see me. I didn't care about anything - and it got much, much worse.' 

Katinka was in hospital for three weeks, where she was prescribed a cascade of powerful drugs to treat her symptoms. As her mood worsened, her psychiatrist prescribed two more drugs - olanzapine, an antipsychotic, sertraline, an antidepressant, and switched the risperidone for fluoxetine (better known by brand name Prozac). 

Katinka spent the next year in a near-catatonic state, in and out of hospital, or needing to be cared for at home. 

It's difficult to reconcile her story with the neat, articulate woman sitting on the sofa as we talk. She's super-fit, and her North London home is beautifully decorated. Lily and Oscar bang about upstairs and she occasionally calls up to ask them to keep the noise down. But during her 'lost year' she became, she says, 'a stranger to everyone who loved me'. 
 'I felt no emotion at all,' she says. 'Oscar later said that for a whole year I didn't cry or laugh. He said: ""Mummy, if a unicorn had come into the room, you wouldn't have noticed.""  
'I've always been the sort of person who takes on too much,' she explains. 'But taking antidepressants turned me into a zombie who needed a 24-hour carer. I gained 3st and for nine of those 12 months I couldn't wash or dress myself properly or even finish a sentence.' 

According to the NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre, 57.1 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written last year, almost double the number in 2004. But depression is a multi-layered disorder and while these drugs appear to help some people, scientists have only a hazy idea about how they work. 

Some now question whether they work at all, as Good Health reported last week. And there are also concerns about their side-effects. Katinka is convinced it was the drugs she was prescribed - or rather their side-effects - that caused her symptoms, effectively stealing a year of her life. 

One of the side-effects of olanzapine is insatiable hunger. Whippet-thin - she's normally a size 6 - Katinka was the kind of mother who wouldn't have sweets in the house. 'But I started buying two or three bags of popcorn and three bags of Liquorice Allsorts and eating the lot,' she says. 

She was unable to care for herself, so her supportive ex-husband paid for a 24-hour-carer who helped to wash and dress her. 

'I felt no emotion at all,' she says. 'Oscar later said that for a whole year I didn't cry or laugh. He said: ""Mummy, if a unicorn had come into the room, you wouldn't have noticed."" 

'But I was being treated at an expensive private hospital and my family thought: ""Surely they know what they're doing?""' 
   
Katinka feels lucky she has suffered no lasting side-effects and has become a passionate campaigner against SSRIs 

So should Katinka ever have been prescribed antidepressants? 

Since 2004, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has recommended talking therapies rather than drugs for mild to moderate depression. 

But prescriptions for antidepressants have soared, with a staggering one in 11 adults in Britain estimated to be taking them - and a recent U.S. study found 69 per cent of those taking these pills may not actually be suffering from depression. 

In spring 2013, Katinka booked herself back into the private hospital, where she was prescribed the powerful mood-stabilising drug lithium, most often used to treat the manic episodes of bipolar disorder. 'People kept asking: ""Are you better or worse?"" But it was just a morass of awfulness,' she says. 'I felt nothing. I knew that if the children ran in front of a bus, I wouldn't react.' 

She moved into a flat, 'effectively abandoning my children' and began to drink heavily. 'I was going to the supermarket at 2am to buy vodka and Nytol tablets, which I was consuming in dangerous quantities,' she says. 

'I was unwashed, unkempt; shuffling round in an old, stained dressing gown, I had giant cuts in my skin where I'd scratched myself in a frenzy of self-mutilation, and I started smoking absurd amounts, sometimes 70 cigarettes a day. 

'When my children came to visit, they were so shocked they burst into tears.' 

In September, out of sheer desperation, Katinka took herself to St Charles, an NHS hospital in West London and begged to be admitted. She was sectioned - and, critically, taken off all the drugs she'd been given. 'They wanted to see what worked and what didn't,' she says. 

Apart from a very low dose of another SSRI, venlafaxine, she went 'cold turkey' - a move she believes saved her life. 

The withdrawal symptoms, which lasted two weeks, were 'indescribably horrendous', she says. 'I was shaking, crying uncontrollably day and night.' But at the same time, miraculously, she could feel herself coming back from the brink. 

'My pleasure in things returned as quickly as it had disappeared, literally overnight,' she says. 'It was like coming out of a year-long coma.' 

Katinka was in hospital for four weeks - she lost 1½ st and started to organise her life from her hospital bed, even managing to get a job. 'They didn't know I went for the interview from a mental ward...' 
 I was unwashed, unkempt; shuffling round in an old, stained dressing gown, I had giant cuts in my skin where I'd scratched myself in a frenzy of self-mutilation, and I started smoking absurd amounts  
She rented a house for herself and the children and went home. Two weeks after stopping the by-now very low dose venlafaxine, she was fully herself again. 

'I will never forget just the simple enjoyment of being with my children. They lost their mum for a year. Nothing can replace the stories we didn't read, the hugs we didn't share.' 

For Dr David Healy, a professor of psychiatry at Cardiff University, Katinka's experience, although extreme, highlights the dangers of drug side-effects that are too often ignored. A leading critic of SSRIs, he believes they act as no more than a placebo, albeit one with some unpleasant side-effects including nausea, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. 

Furthermore, they can actually cause the kind of problems they are meant to help. 

'We know that one-fifth of people in clinical trials are more anxious on the drugs than less, and one in 20 drops out of the trial because they become so horribly agitated, they don't want to keep taking them,' he says. 

A smaller, but still significant, number of people - he estimates one in 100 - experiences hallucinations or paranoid delusions. 

Dr Healy created the website RxISK to draw attention to the number of serious adverse 'events' associated with many widely prescribed drugs, including psychiatric pills. He believes there are thousands more patients with stories like Katinka's. 'People don't realise it's the drugs that are causing their symptoms,' he says. 

But this is highly controversial. Professor Allan Young, chair of mood disorders at King's College, London, says: 'SSRIs have been under intense scrutiny for a number of years because of the claims by Dr Healy and others, but there's nothing in the literature to back up the claim SSRIs make suicidal thoughts or psychosis are increased in patients taking these drugs. 

'Psychosis does not usually follow treatment with SSRIs,' he says. 'But people who are depressed can become psychotic for a variety of reasons. 

'We are worried about the use of antidepressants in bipolar depression, for instance, when not only do they not work, they can cause a switch into mania.' 

When Katinka came home, Lily and Oscar clung to her as though she'd come back from the dead. Three years later, they seem well-adjusted teenagers, who will only talk reluctantly about the year they lost their mum. 

'It was as though someone had stolen Mummy, and I kept thinking if only we could find the switch to switch her back on, but we couldn't,' says Lily, now 14. 

Katinka feels lucky she has suffered no lasting side-effects and has become a passionate campaigner against SSRIs. 

'We all want to believe in a magic pill. We want to think that if the going gets really tough, there's something that will make us better,' she says. 'But there really isn't - I needed to face my problems and work them out. Having paid the price, I want to tell people it isn't worth taking the risk.'

A136,"The end has apparently come to the legislative process in Washington, D.C. The Iran nuclear agreement showed that the president will use whatever means he needs to achieve his own agenda. And he has enough Democrats in his hip pocket to ensure he can continue to do this. 
  
According to polling data, 79 percent of Americans were opposed to this agreement. Proponents of the agreement quickly stated that these people didn’t have the facts. What were the facts? Like Obamacare, they weren’t made available. Another case of John Gruberism — the American people are too stupid to understand. Or Pelosi-ism: “How will we know what is in this legislation unless we pass it?” 
  
So this president used his 42 Democratic buddies to ram through this agreement. Thus a precedent is set. Anytime this president wants something, he lines up his 42 buddies and they once again ram through what he wants, regardless of what the American people want. Regardless of the legislative process our founding fathers established to ensure equal representation of citizens and the balance of governmental powers. 
  
It seems that both this president and these Democrats don’t care that they are elected to represent all the people. As one senator told my wife in a letter “(W)e know what is bet for you.” 

 
  
How terrifying that we’ve elected people who turn their backs on their constituents when the president tells them what to do. They now have the ability to pass any legislation they want. And there’s nothing that the American people can do about it. It apparently is a legal technicality which they gleefully use. We condemn Russian President Putin. But our legislative process and press aren’t a lot different. 
  
If the American people don’t cry out loudly against this process of ignoring the people and the legislative processes we have long used, then we’ll get an ever more powerful presidency. One that at some point may not need a Congress or Senate.

A137,"(#401: 11 November 1989, 3 weeks) Track listing: The Road To Hell (Part I)/The Road To Hell (Part II)/You Must Be Evil/Texas/Looking For A Rainbow/Your Warm And Tender Love/Daytona/That’s What They Always Say/I Just Wanna Be With You/Tell Me There’s A Heaven PROLOGUE I On 26 May 1989, Don Revie died in Murrayfield Hospital, Edinburgh. He was sixty-one years old and had for some time been suffering from motor neurone disease. After leaving Leeds United to manage the England team fifteen years previously, he never recaptured his former success, either with England or the UAE and other Arabic teams which he later managed. Gigantic question marks, mainly centred on financial matters and fair play, ensured that he became a figure conveniently forgotten about by the football establishment, left in the corner, out of sight, purposely neglected. PROLOGUE II In 1989, Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest finished third in the League and won both the League Cup and the Full Members Cup. They also reached the semi-final of that year’s FA Cup. Their opponents were Liverpool. But they lost to Liverpool in the replay. A replay was necessary because the original match had to be abandoned after six minutes of play. The original FA Cup semi-final, which was to be played at the Hillsborough stadium. “She says that mess it don’t get no better There’s gonna come a day Someone gonna get killed out there” ENVOI I Clough and Revie grew up about a mile apart from each other in Middlesbrough; Clough in Valley Road, Revie in Bell Street. In between used to be the old Middlesbrough ground, Ayresome Park, and there still exists Albert Park. As managers, Clough and Revie had little time for each other, as became painfully apparent when Clough surprisingly but only briefly replaced Revie as manager of Leeds United. Revie was keen and quick to get away, in the first instance to Leicester City as a player, but Clough never neglected his roots. What is certain is that both Clough and Revie would have frequently spent time in the now-defunct establishment which was just across the road from Valley Park; indeed it was where Clough met his wife Barbara, and where he would frequently retreat for discussions with his sidekick Peter Taylor. This establishment was Rea’s Ice Cream parlour. “A promise to get out That’s what it’s all about” BACKGROUND I Camillo Rea ‘s father was from New York but somehow ended up in Middlesbrough. He started an ice cream business – essentially a factory and a cafe, later to be followed by numerous other cafes through north-east England – but was killed in 1946 when a ship taking him to Canada was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean. Camillo and his brother Gaetano took over and expanded the family business. Camillo had seven children, all of whom were expected to follow him into the business. The young Chris recalls having to work in his father’s coffee bar, serving behind the counter and washing the dishes. Gradually becoming disillusioned with this way of living, Chris eventually opted to pursue a career in music. A rift developed between him and his father, and although Camillo Rea lived on until almost the end of 2010, there appears never to have been a reconciliation. “Tell me that they’re happy now Papa tell me that it’s so” THE CLASH It was their last single. It came out in late September 1985, the same week as “Slave To The Rhythm,” “Alive And Kicking” and others. It was the only single from the Clash album that radio and Sony would much rather have you forget or not know that it ever existed. I haven’t spoken much here about The Clash because they never had a number one album, although both Give ‘Em Enough Rope and Combat Rock – their most “American” records – came very close, and maybe also because they didn’t quite avoid becoming the critically acclaimed albums act that they, or at least most of them, had not wanted to become in the first place. At least, not when Mick Jones was there. But by 1985 Jones was two years gone, and there were just Strummer, Simonon, Rhodes and three new recruits, trying to work their way back to why they had ever wanted to do this, as if they had known more about what The Clash should have meant than the man who had originally formed the group and recruited them. You hardly ever hear, or hear about, “This Is England,” but it is The Clash and Joe Strummer’s greatest and most forsaken moment. Always best when lost, alone and confused – “Complete Control” starts out as a diatribe against their record company but ends up questioning art and motive, “White Man In Hammersmith Palais” demonstrates how someone can live and grow up somewhere and not realise until too late that they know nothing about their own home, “Death Is A Star” being the romantic response to “Decades” – the song begins with a midtempo dub rhythm, slowly joined by a loop of children’s voices and a cloud of synthesiser. And then Strummer angrily barges in with his voice, as exhausted as Lennon’s at the end of “Twist And Shout,” and grim guitar, and sings about what might be a riot, or an extermination process  (“Are they howling out or doing somebody harm?”), during which a woman grabs him coldly by the arm and declares “THIS IS ENGLAND.” The chorus follows, with the title echoed by a huge football crowd. This is the 1985 England of Bradford, Broadwater Farm and Heysel. Strummer then muses about the wretched lot of the Falklands soldier, or just the ordinary worker (“He won’t go for the carrot/They beat him by the pole”). The steady decline continues. “I got my motorcycle jacket but I’m walking all the time” “I’m going to Texas I’m going to Texas Watch me walking Watch me walking” both anticipates and outdoes “Motorcycle Emptiness”; the aimless and pointlessness of “rebellion” with punk having resulted in little more than the Falklands (“Ice from  a dying creed”). Then the mood gets violent again; there are race riots – they have ended up where they started, but is all that people thought a “White Riot” meant? – and then the British beat themselves over the head with their own batons, shrug their shoulders and say well that’s the way it is, THIS IS ENGLAND, the “land of illegal dances” half a decade ahead of rave (perhaps just another, more placid baton). “The newspapers being read/Who dares to protest?” Strummer asks rhetorically. Then everything falls, dies away except that blunt guitar, grinding out its punk riff – DO ANY OF YOU DOUGHNUTS REMEMBER WHAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO MEAN ONCE? – seemingly forever, alone on the planet. The music discreetly fades until the guitar exhausts itself, stops and gives a feedback weep, for its country and this fruitless culture. HELL Cut The Crap is a mess, but the exhilarating mess punk had once promised to be; the opening “Dictator” with its arsenal of beatboxes and Video City samples, suggests the band Big Audio Dynamite might have been (the words here which ring out of the page are: “You know once there was freedom/You know how dangerous that can be”) and it is no surprise that in the following year both approaches fused and BAD put out the sometimes fantastic No 10 Upping Street – essentially a Clash-in-exile album (“Sightsee MC” still sounds like the last song you’d ever hear in London). This record, however – it’s only the penultimate number one of the eighties, but we can close down the decade with it – begins with a different use of found sounds; there is an ominous drone in the middleground. In the distance we hear a ghostly piano, picking out a nursery song the five-year-old piano student at home, at his piano, with his Ministeps To Music tutorial books, and a black-and-white television on the other side of the same room, the blue light, the theme songs, the fear while closer up there are scattered voices from radio scans, coming from all across the world, as though this were the fatal and total pile-up and all that was left of the world, a vague reminder of what humanity once aspired to. But there also enter deep Cooder curves of Middlesbrough delta guitar and that drone won’t go away. It is the M25 motorway which orbits, but does not enter, London at a twenty-five-mile radius. Travelling into the city by train from any direction, its appearance is a welcome signifier, indicating that the traveller is almost home. But the thing is that Britain will never learn, has always been parsimonious about so many things that it becomes destructive. In fifties America they had giant refrigerators, comic books and rock ‘n’ roll; in Britain we continued to allow ourselves to be punished with ration books and Hoggart lectures. It is as if Britain, which is fatally an island, has always felt unworthy of itself, thinks that it does not deserve what it receives, and yet fiercely protects the interests of those who have received far, far more than they deserve. Britain was never America. America has long, unbroken highways; motorways here are higgledy-piggledy things, forever winding around and narrowing themselves to protect the interests of landowners whose privileges date back to the time of agrarian enclosures. Britain is in the north of Europe and is therefore cold and damp most of the time. Most importantly, Britain cannot, or will not, plan ahead. The reason why getting around London by road is such an arduous task is because road-widening was rejected by vested interests in the nineteenth century who preferred roads which had been built to accommodate horse-drawn Victorian carriages. And I do not suppose that anybody involved in planning the M25, which by 1989 had been in operation for around three years – indeed was opened by the Prime Minister herself – had the remotest notion that its highways would rapidly be filled up by motorists keen on avoiding London. All motorists who probably also harboured the dream of getting away, of cruising down long, unbroken highways, but invariably think it’s always the other motorists’ fault. But the narrator here has not quite broken down; instead, he is sitting still, in gridlock. He sees a woman in the distance. She slowly comes up to his car, and when she bends down to speak to the driver, “A fearful pressure paralysed me in my shadow.” She asks “Son, what are you doing here?” He explains – calling her “Mama” with the implication that she is a ghost (“My fear for you has turned me in my grave”) – that he has “come to the valley of the rich” to sell himself. But she sadly tells him that in fact he is on the road to Hell. If the woman grabbing Strummer by the arm in “This Is England” is Thatcher – how could she not be? – then this woman’s identity is more ambiguous. It could theoretically be a gloating Thatcher, but I note that Rea’s actual mother, Winifred, died in 1983. But the way in which he announces the song and album’s name makes it feel like the last song anybody would hear. Martin Ditcham’s drums kick in, and the song starts up proper. The trick becomes evident to those who would listen – and Rea makes a point of making sure that the listener doesn’t miss hearing what he has to say – namely that, although this music superficially sounds like Dire Straits/yuppie-pleasing hi-fi/car-friendly AoR, he is using the uniform of the enemy to turn them back on themselves. “I’m underneath the streetlights But the light of joy I know Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows” “And at night, there came another dimension...of terror. As I prowled, I knew how scared I was, dead scared, yet not too scared to prowl.” (Ian S Munro) “And the perverted fear of violence Chokes a smile on every face” We’re really not too far away here from “This Is England,” are we? Nor indeed from Heaven 17, with the useless credit jamming up the roads. “Look out world, take a good look What comes down here You must learn this lesson fast And learn it well” If the second part of “The Road To Hell” predicates anything, it’s Leonard Cohen’s “The Future” from three years later. Possibly the most depressing thing about the latter song is how painfully accurate all his predictions have turned out to be – “Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima” indeed. I don’t know whether Cohen ever heard “The Road To Hell” but I do know that before going solo, Chris Rea played in a band called The Beautiful Losers. “This ain’t no upwardly mobile freeway OH NO, THIS IS THE ROAD TO HELL.” Upon which guitars, played by both Rea and Robert Ahwai, scream out jagged, torrid lines which have much more to do with Neil Young than with Knopfler. Always on this album the guitars sound as though in insurmountable pain. BACKGROUND II Chris Rea did not actually buy a guitar until he was in his early twenties; a late time to start. He taught himself to play it. Although influenced by his parents’ opera and light classical records, as a musician his main influences came from the blues, notably Sonny Boy Williamso, Charley Patton and Blind Willie Johnson; contemporary guitarists he admired included Ry Cooder and Joe Walsh. Although The Beautiful Losers were voted Best Newcomers in the Melody Maker poll of 1975, he had already been signed as a solo artist to Magnet Records the year before by the label’s head of A&R, Pete Waterman, but had to wait until 1978 before “Fool (If You Think It’s Over)” became a Billboard Top 20 hit. In Britain it missed the charts entirely on its first release and only scraped into the Top 30 upon reissue; it wasn’t until Elkie Brooks’ 1982 hit cover of the same song that the UK really began to pay attention to Rea’s music. He spent much of the eighties steadily building up his profile, particularly on the Continent, where he was a huge star long before his UK breakthrough. Given, however, that whenever he hit big he felt obliged to conform to what other people expected of him, it is no surprise that, following serious illness in the early 2000s, Rea resolved to revert to the kind of music he wanted to make, since when he has re-established himself as a highly respected blues performer who continues to record and tour with great success. He comes home from work, and his young daughter is crying over something they’ve shown on the news. He is outraged – “This ain’t even dinner time!,” “What’s wrong with you?,” “You don’t have to show that stuff/Can’t you show us some RESPECT?,” and threatening “I wish you were here”s. He concludes, chillingly, “You must be evil” – a warped and twisted media ready to make children cry and a nation collapse (“You giving out some bad ideas here”). “Looking For A Rainbow” grinds on for an agonising eight minutes and twenty seconds; he and his family have come down to the valley (of the shadow of death?) to seek their fortune – or so it would seem, because as the song progresses their real mission becomes clearer, “Maggie’s little children.../looking for Maggie’s farm” are actually here to exact their revenge... “You can’t leave us dying this time ‘Cos we’re all around your door” Between 2008-10 it was erroneously stated in some newspapers that Chris Rea had donated large sums of money to the Conservative Party and that he had been a long-time Conservative supporter. What the newspapers had done was to confuse him with another Chris Rea, a Sheffield businessman who is Group Managing Director of mechanical seal manufacturers AESSEAL and who had indeed donated money to the Conservatives. Although I note the strong work ethic that comes from growing up in an Italian family – and I should know – I am also aware that no one could have made a record like The Road To Hell and be a Conservative. Instead, in the album sleeve, Rea acknowledges “Everyone in all the governments.” Given that he values personal freedom and driving in particular, however, it is perhaps best to view the record as the rueful reflections of a disappointed small-c conservative, much in the vein of disappointed literary socialists such as Orwell, Huxley and Koestler. In “Your Warm And Tender Love,” he succeeds in finding refuge from the growing storm in love, the light which pierces all darkness. By the time of “I Just Wanna Be With You,” however, his need is turning into an obsession. “I just wanna be with you,” he reiterates, over and over, “’til the final curtain falls” and as an alternative to “know[ing] nothing at all.” “I know there’s a price to pay for doing what we do,” he cryptically admits, but that is no deterrence to their doing it. “That’s What They Always Say” is a sardonic rejoinder to those who talk all the time about getting away, making the break from the rat race, but who in their hearts know they’ll stay right where they are, gambling on that golden bridge just around the corner, “always one more thing to do.” But finally there is the realisation that there is no escape from this voluntary self-imprisonment. “The money junkie fades away,” remarks Rea, perhaps aware that he too will opt to hang on. But there are those dreams, the dreams of “Texas.” As the skies of Britain collapse around him and his wife (“Been watching some TV...It’s all gone crazy”) he fantasises about a place that priorities quarterbacks over quarterlights – “Warm winds blowing/Heating blue sky/And a road that goes forever.” Yet he concludes: “Watch me walking.” If he gets there, however, he’ll drive in his “Daytona,” a tribute to the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona classic car, which ceased production in 1973 but of which he still dreams exquisitely (“Twelve wild horses in silver chains/Calling out to me”). As with the “sweet angel” in “I Just Wanna Be With You,” he implores the Daytona to “shine your light on me.” Because nothing could be darker than this. It is almost the end of the record, this story of the mad dreams of the man stuck in his car who, for the second time, comes home to find his daughter – by 1989 Rea had two young daughters; nowhere are you really made to forget that this record is the work of a parent – watching television. And now, it is about abuse, and it is about violence and death – and beyond outrage, the narrator is at a loss what to say. “Grandpa says they’re happy now” – this is a song which involves three generations. He knows what grandpa is saying, and why he’s saying it, but he can’t find it in himself to believe it- Max Middleton’s string section freezes on the word “ice.” She is asking him, his little girl, to tell her that there’s a heaven, that these people will go somewhere, because otherwise why is she seeing all of this? He freezes and the strings descend into mild discordance before again settling. He turns to us for an answer: “So do I tell her that it’s true? That there’s a place for me and you?” But you can tell – “every painful crack of bones” – that he can’t tell her this story. The key line is: “What makes those men do what they do?” ...and you could say that this tale, this Then Play Long story, has been heading towards this conclusion all along, that the fundamental problem is not simply a question of why men do what they do, but the question of what constitutes evil. Because the closing vocal section of this song is truly terrifying, as the timpani rolls and the camera pulls back – “And I’m looking at the father and the son” as though the end credits are rolling, “And I’m looking at the mother and the daughter” – and then the strings become atonal again, with a thudding timpani heartbeat, as he sings “And I’m watching them in tears of pain/And I’m watching them suffer/DON’T TELL THAT LITTLE GIRL/TELL ME.” And then he sings the chorus again, but this time he’s the one asking, desperate to be convinced that it’s true, that some redemption must exist somewhere. The orchestra plays out as though this were a Lloyd Webber musical, and after some “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina” oboe flourishes, the song, and the record, and its decade, are all laid to rest. There is nothing left save the silence. The question is not just how a record like this ever got to number one, but what it means in greater terms. We closed down the sixties with “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” saw out the seventies with “I Was Only Joking,” and now we are nearly done with the eighties, by way of its epitaph. But with “Tell Me There’s A Heaven” in particular – one of this tale’s key songs – there is the sense of a greater and more horrific truth being revealed, and revelation is perhaps the last thing that needed to be done, since it all seems to have happened, as the book title goes, in plain sight. Here we are at the end of a decade whose number one albums have nearly all been about the problems faced by men and women and/or lovers in communicating with each other, and it ends, to all intents and purposes, with the notion that it is the medium itself which is the true evil, a declaration of intent by somebody – Rea in 1989 was thirty-eight years old – who has lived through all of Then Play Long and knows the whole story. The story of pop and rock music only really concerned with alerting its very young audience to an adult world. An era which may prove to be, as the Descendants have it, rotten to the core. And you realise why Rea might have been so keen to get his wife and kids over to Texas – as Americans glance at them on their long, endless highways and retort: “well, why do you think we left Britain in the first place?” – or anywhere that’s far, far away from evil people like Thatcher, Savile, Sutcliffe, Gadd, a country rotting because of its very own and deeply perverted traditions. And yet there is still hope. The half-Scottish Joe Strummer pointedly called his best  song “This Is England.” And while many might still view the road to Budapest as the road to Hell, maybe that signifies a major turnaround in how people are prepared to act towards their fellow humans. Perhaps the corporate media’s bluff has been fatally called; get away from television, newspapers, the internet, and realise that you can still make your own decisions about how the world operates. Strip away the neoliberal gaffa tape and you’ll find ordinary, generous and welcoming people beneath. CONCLUSION As the cover of this album clearly demonstrates, our world doesn't have to be compacted into profitable garbage like a spent car, and even in the darkest of corners, there always lurks a rainbow.

A137,"(#401: 11 November 1989, 3 weeks) Track listing: The Road To Hell (Part I)/The Road To Hell (Part II)/You Must Be Evil/Texas/Looking For A Rainbow/Your Warm And Tender Love/Daytona/That’s What They Always Say/I Just Wanna Be With You/Tell Me There’s A Heaven PROLOGUE I On 26 May 1989, Don Revie died in Murrayfield Hospital, Edinburgh. He was sixty-one years old and had for some time been suffering from motor neurone disease. After leaving Leeds United to manage the England team fifteen years previously, he never recaptured his former success, either with England or the UAE and other Arabic teams which he later managed. Gigantic question marks, mainly centred on financial matters and fair play, ensured that he became a figure conveniently forgotten about by the football establishment, left in the corner, out of sight, purposely neglected. PROLOGUE II In 1989, Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest finished third in the League and won both the League Cup and the Full Members Cup. They also reached the semi-final of that year’s FA Cup. Their opponents were Liverpool. But they lost to Liverpool in the replay. A replay was necessary because the original match had to be abandoned after six minutes of play. The original FA Cup semi-final, which was to be played at the Hillsborough stadium. “She says that mess it don’t get no better There’s gonna come a day Someone gonna get killed out there” ENVOI I Clough and Revie grew up about a mile apart from each other in Middlesbrough; Clough in Valley Road, Revie in Bell Street. In between used to be the old Middlesbrough ground, Ayresome Park, and there still exists Albert Park. As managers, Clough and Revie had little time for each other, as became painfully apparent when Clough surprisingly but only briefly replaced Revie as manager of Leeds United. Revie was keen and quick to get away, in the first instance to Leicester City as a player, but Clough never neglected his roots. What is certain is that both Clough and Revie would have frequently spent time in the now-defunct establishment which was just across the road from Valley Park; indeed it was where Clough met his wife Barbara, and where he would frequently retreat for discussions with his sidekick Peter Taylor. This establishment was Rea’s Ice Cream parlour. “A promise to get out That’s what it’s all about” BACKGROUND I Camillo Rea ‘s father was from New York but somehow ended up in Middlesbrough. He started an ice cream business – essentially a factory and a cafe, later to be followed by numerous other cafes through north-east England – but was killed in 1946 when a ship taking him to Canada was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean. Camillo and his brother Gaetano took over and expanded the family business. Camillo had seven children, all of whom were expected to follow him into the business. The young Chris recalls having to work in his father’s coffee bar, serving behind the counter and washing the dishes. Gradually becoming disillusioned with this way of living, Chris eventually opted to pursue a career in music. A rift developed between him and his father, and although Camillo Rea lived on until almost the end of 2010, there appears never to have been a reconciliation. “Tell me that they’re happy now Papa tell me that it’s so” THE CLASH It was their last single. It came out in late September 1985, the same week as “Slave To The Rhythm,” “Alive And Kicking” and others. It was the only single from the Clash album that radio and Sony would much rather have you forget or not know that it ever existed. I haven’t spoken much here about The Clash because they never had a number one album, although both Give ‘Em Enough Rope and Combat Rock – their most “American” records – came very close, and maybe also because they didn’t quite avoid becoming the critically acclaimed albums act that they, or at least most of them, had not wanted to become in the first place. At least, not when Mick Jones was there. But by 1985 Jones was two years gone, and there were just Strummer, Simonon, Rhodes and three new recruits, trying to work their way back to why they had ever wanted to do this, as if they had known more about what The Clash should have meant than the man who had originally formed the group and recruited them. You hardly ever hear, or hear about, “This Is England,” but it is The Clash and Joe Strummer’s greatest and most forsaken moment. Always best when lost, alone and confused – “Complete Control” starts out as a diatribe against their record company but ends up questioning art and motive, “White Man In Hammersmith Palais” demonstrates how someone can live and grow up somewhere and not realise until too late that they know nothing about their own home, “Death Is A Star” being the romantic response to “Decades” – the song begins with a midtempo dub rhythm, slowly joined by a loop of children’s voices and a cloud of synthesiser. And then Strummer angrily barges in with his voice, as exhausted as Lennon’s at the end of “Twist And Shout,” and grim guitar, and sings about what might be a riot, or an extermination process  (“Are they howling out or doing somebody harm?”), during which a woman grabs him coldly by the arm and declares “THIS IS ENGLAND.” The chorus follows, with the title echoed by a huge football crowd. This is the 1985 England of Bradford, Broadwater Farm and Heysel. Strummer then muses about the wretched lot of the Falklands soldier, or just the ordinary worker (“He won’t go for the carrot/They beat him by the pole”). The steady decline continues. “I got my motorcycle jacket but I’m walking all the time” “I’m going to Texas I’m going to Texas Watch me walking Watch me walking” both anticipates and outdoes “Motorcycle Emptiness”; the aimless and pointlessness of “rebellion” with punk having resulted in little more than the Falklands (“Ice from  a dying creed”). Then the mood gets violent again; there are race riots – they have ended up where they started, but is all that people thought a “White Riot” meant? – and then the British beat themselves over the head with their own batons, shrug their shoulders and say well that’s the way it is, THIS IS ENGLAND, the “land of illegal dances” half a decade ahead of rave (perhaps just another, more placid baton). “The newspapers being read/Who dares to protest?” Strummer asks rhetorically. Then everything falls, dies away except that blunt guitar, grinding out its punk riff – DO ANY OF YOU DOUGHNUTS REMEMBER WHAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO MEAN ONCE? – seemingly forever, alone on the planet. The music discreetly fades until the guitar exhausts itself, stops and gives a feedback weep, for its country and this fruitless culture. HELL Cut The Crap is a mess, but the exhilarating mess punk had once promised to be; the opening “Dictator” with its arsenal of beatboxes and Video City samples, suggests the band Big Audio Dynamite might have been (the words here which ring out of the page are: “You know once there was freedom/You know how dangerous that can be”) and it is no surprise that in the following year both approaches fused and BAD put out the sometimes fantastic No 10 Upping Street – essentially a Clash-in-exile album (“Sightsee MC” still sounds like the last song you’d ever hear in London). This record, however – it’s only the penultimate number one of the eighties, but we can close down the decade with it – begins with a different use of found sounds; there is an ominous drone in the middleground. In the distance we hear a ghostly piano, picking out a nursery song the five-year-old piano student at home, at his piano, with his Ministeps To Music tutorial books, and a black-and-white television on the other side of the same room, the blue light, the theme songs, the fear while closer up there are scattered voices from radio scans, coming from all across the world, as though this were the fatal and total pile-up and all that was left of the world, a vague reminder of what humanity once aspired to. But there also enter deep Cooder curves of Middlesbrough delta guitar and that drone won’t go away. It is the M25 motorway which orbits, but does not enter, London at a twenty-five-mile radius. Travelling into the city by train from any direction, its appearance is a welcome signifier, indicating that the traveller is almost home. But the thing is that Britain will never learn, has always been parsimonious about so many things that it becomes destructive. In fifties America they had giant refrigerators, comic books and rock ‘n’ roll; in Britain we continued to allow ourselves to be punished with ration books and Hoggart lectures. It is as if Britain, which is fatally an island, has always felt unworthy of itself, thinks that it does not deserve what it receives, and yet fiercely protects the interests of those who have received far, far more than they deserve. Britain was never America. America has long, unbroken highways; motorways here are higgledy-piggledy things, forever winding around and narrowing themselves to protect the interests of landowners whose privileges date back to the time of agrarian enclosures. Britain is in the north of Europe and is therefore cold and damp most of the time. Most importantly, Britain cannot, or will not, plan ahead. The reason why getting around London by road is such an arduous task is because road-widening was rejected by vested interests in the nineteenth century who preferred roads which had been built to accommodate horse-drawn Victorian carriages. And I do not suppose that anybody involved in planning the M25, which by 1989 had been in operation for around three years – indeed was opened by the Prime Minister herself – had the remotest notion that its highways would rapidly be filled up by motorists keen on avoiding London. All motorists who probably also harboured the dream of getting away, of cruising down long, unbroken highways, but invariably think it’s always the other motorists’ fault.

But she sadly tells him that in fact he is on the road to Hell.

A137,"(#401: 11 November 1989, 3 weeks) Track listing: The Road To Hell (Part I)/The Road To Hell (Part II)/You Must Be Evil/Texas/Looking For A Rainbow/Your Warm And Tender Love/Daytona/That’s What They Always Say/I Just Wanna Be With You/Tell Me There’s A Heaven PROLOGUE I On 26 May 1989, Don Revie died in Murrayfield Hospital, Edinburgh. He was sixty-one years old and had for some time been suffering from motor neurone disease. After leaving Leeds United to manage the England team fifteen years previously, he never recaptured his former success, either with England or the UAE and other Arabic teams which he later managed. Gigantic question marks, mainly centred on financial matters and fair play, ensured that he became a figure conveniently forgotten about by the football establishment, left in the corner, out of sight, purposely neglected. PROLOGUE II In 1989, Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest finished third in the League and won both the League Cup and the Full Members Cup. They also reached the semi-final of that year’s FA Cup. Their opponents were Liverpool. But they lost to Liverpool in the replay. A replay was necessary because the original match had to be abandoned after six minutes of play. The original FA Cup semi-final, which was to be played at the Hillsborough stadium. “She says that mess it don’t get no better There’s gonna come a day Someone gonna get killed out there” ENVOI I Clough and Revie grew up about a mile apart from each other in Middlesbrough; Clough in Valley Road, Revie in Bell Street. In between used to be the old Middlesbrough ground, Ayresome Park, and there still exists Albert Park. As managers, Clough and Revie had little time for each other, as became painfully apparent when Clough surprisingly but only briefly replaced Revie as manager of Leeds United. Revie was keen and quick to get away, in the first instance to Leicester City as a player, but Clough never neglected his roots. What is certain is that both Clough and Revie would have frequently spent time in the now-defunct establishment which was just across the road from Valley Park; indeed it was where Clough met his wife Barbara, and where he would frequently retreat for discussions with his sidekick Peter Taylor. This establishment was Rea’s Ice Cream parlour. “A promise to get out That’s what it’s all about” BACKGROUND I Camillo Rea ‘s father was from New York but somehow ended up in Middlesbrough. He started an ice cream business – essentially a factory and a cafe, later to be followed by numerous other cafes through north-east England – but was killed in 1946 when a ship taking him to Canada was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean. Camillo and his brother Gaetano took over and expanded the family business. Camillo had seven children, all of whom were expected to follow him into the business. The young Chris recalls having to work in his father’s coffee bar, serving behind the counter and washing the dishes. Gradually becoming disillusioned with this way of living, Chris eventually opted to pursue a career in music. A rift developed between him and his father, and although Camillo Rea lived on until almost the end of 2010, there appears never to have been a reconciliation. “Tell me that they’re happy now Papa tell me that it’s so” THE CLASH It was their last single. It came out in late September 1985, the same week as “Slave To The Rhythm,” “Alive And Kicking” and others. It was the only single from the Clash album that radio and Sony would much rather have you forget or not know that it ever existed. I haven’t spoken much here about The Clash because they never had a number one album, although both Give ‘Em Enough Rope and Combat Rock – their most “American” records – came very close, and maybe also because they didn’t quite avoid becoming the critically acclaimed albums act that they, or at least most of them, had not wanted to become in the first place. At least, not when Mick Jones was there. But by 1985 Jones was two years gone, and there were just Strummer, Simonon, Rhodes and three new recruits, trying to work their way back to why they had ever wanted to do this, as if they had known more about what The Clash should have meant than the man who had originally formed the group and recruited them. You hardly ever hear, or hear about, “This Is England,” but it is The Clash and Joe Strummer’s greatest and most forsaken moment. Always best when lost, alone and confused – “Complete Control” starts out as a diatribe against their record company but ends up questioning art and motive, “White Man In Hammersmith Palais” demonstrates how someone can live and grow up somewhere and not realise until too late that they know nothing about their own home, “Death Is A Star” being the romantic response to “Decades” – the song begins with a midtempo dub rhythm, slowly joined by a loop of children’s voices and a cloud of synthesiser. And then Strummer angrily barges in with his voice, as exhausted as Lennon’s at the end of “Twist And Shout,” and grim guitar, and sings about what might be a riot, or an extermination process  (“Are they howling out or doing somebody harm?”), during which a woman grabs him coldly by the arm and declares “THIS IS ENGLAND.” The chorus follows, with the title echoed by a huge football crowd. This is the 1985 England of Bradford, Broadwater Farm and Heysel. Strummer then muses about the wretched lot of the Falklands soldier, or just the ordinary worker (“He won’t go for the carrot/They beat him by the pole”). The steady decline continues. “I got my motorcycle jacket but I’m walking all the time” “I’m going to Texas I’m going to Texas Watch me walking Watch me walking” both anticipates and outdoes “Motorcycle Emptiness”; the aimless and pointlessness of “rebellion” with punk having resulted in little more than the Falklands (“Ice from  a dying creed”). Then the mood gets violent again; there are race riots – they have ended up where they started, but is all that people thought a “White Riot” meant? – and then the British beat themselves over the head with their own batons, shrug their shoulders and say well that’s the way it is, THIS IS ENGLAND, the “land of illegal dances” half a decade ahead of rave (perhaps just another, more placid baton). “The newspapers being read/Who dares to protest?” Strummer asks rhetorically. Then everything falls, dies away except that blunt guitar, grinding out its punk riff – DO ANY OF YOU DOUGHNUTS REMEMBER WHAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO MEAN ONCE? – seemingly forever, alone on the planet. The music discreetly fades until the guitar exhausts itself, stops and gives a feedback weep, for its country and this fruitless culture. HELL Cut The Crap is a mess, but the exhilarating mess punk had once promised to be; the opening “Dictator” with its arsenal of beatboxes and Video City samples, suggests the band Big Audio Dynamite might have been (the words here which ring out of the page are: “You know once there was freedom/You know how dangerous that can be”) and it is no surprise that in the following year both approaches fused and BAD put out the sometimes fantastic No 10 Upping Street – essentially a Clash-in-exile album (“Sightsee MC” still sounds like the last song you’d ever hear in London). This record, however – it’s only the penultimate number one of the eighties, but we can close down the decade with it – begins with a different use of found sounds; there is an ominous drone in the middleground. In the distance we hear a ghostly piano, picking out a nursery song the five-year-old piano student at home, at his piano, with his Ministeps To Music tutorial books, and a black-and-white television on the other side of the same room, the blue light, the theme songs, the fear while closer up there are scattered voices from radio scans, coming from all across the world, as though this were the fatal and total pile-up and all that was left of the world, a vague reminder of what humanity once aspired to. But there also enter deep Cooder curves of Middlesbrough delta guitar and that drone won’t go away. It is the M25 motorway which orbits, but does not enter, London at a twenty-five-mile radius. Travelling into the city by train from any direction, its appearance is a welcome signifier, indicating that the traveller is almost home. But the thing is that Britain will never learn, has always been parsimonious about so many things that it becomes destructive. In fifties America they had giant refrigerators, comic books and rock ‘n’ roll; in Britain we continued to allow ourselves to be punished with ration books and Hoggart lectures. It is as if Britain, which is fatally an island, has always felt unworthy of itself, thinks that it does not deserve what it receives, and yet fiercely protects the interests of those who have received far, far more than they deserve. Britain was never America. America has long, unbroken highways; motorways here are higgledy-piggledy things, forever winding around and narrowing themselves to protect the interests of landowners whose privileges date back to the time of agrarian enclosures. Britain is in the north of Europe and is therefore cold and damp most of the time. Most importantly, Britain cannot, or will not, plan ahead. The reason why getting around London by road is such an arduous task is because road-widening was rejected by vested interests in the nineteenth century who preferred roads which had been built to accommodate horse-drawn Victorian carriages. And I do not suppose that anybody involved in planning the M25, which by 1989 had been in operation for around three years – indeed was opened by the Prime Minister herself – had the remotest notion that its highways would rapidly be filled up by motorists keen on avoiding London. All motorists who probably also harboured the dream of getting away, of cruising down long, unbroken highways, but invariably think it’s always the other motorists’ fault. But the narrator here has not quite broken down; instead, he is sitting still, in gridlock. He sees a woman in the distance. She slowly comes up to his car, and when she bends down to speak to the driver, “A fearful pressure paralysed me in my shadow.” She asks “Son, what are you doing here?” He explains – calling her “Mama” with the implication that she is a ghost (“My fear for you has turned me in my grave”) – that he has “come to the valley of the rich” to sell himself. But she sadly tells him that in fact he is on the road to Hell. If the woman grabbing Strummer by the arm in “This Is England” is Thatcher – how could she not be? – then this woman’s identity is more ambiguous. It could theoretically be a gloating Thatcher, but I note that Rea’s actual mother, Winifred, died in 1983. But the way in which he announces the song and album’s name makes it feel like the last song anybody would hear. Martin Ditcham’s drums kick in, and the song starts up proper. The trick becomes evident to those who would listen – and Rea makes a point of making sure that the listener doesn’t miss hearing what he has to say – namely that, although this music superficially sounds like Dire Straits/yuppie-pleasing hi-fi/car-friendly AoR, he is using the uniform of the enemy to turn them back on themselves. “I’m underneath the streetlights But the light of joy I know Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows” “And at night, there came another dimension...of terror. As I prowled, I knew how scared I was, dead scared, yet not too scared to prowl.” (Ian S Munro) “And the perverted fear of violence Chokes a smile on every face” We’re really not too far away here from “This Is England,” are we? Nor indeed from Heaven 17, with the useless credit jamming up the roads. “Look out world, take a good look What comes down here You must learn this lesson fast And learn it well” If the second part of “The Road To Hell” predicates anything, it’s Leonard Cohen’s “The Future” from three years later. Possibly the most depressing thing about the latter song is how painfully accurate all his predictions have turned out to be – “Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima” indeed. I don’t know whether Cohen ever heard “The Road To Hell” but I do know that before going solo, Chris Rea played in a band called The Beautiful Losers. “This ain’t no upwardly mobile freeway OH NO, THIS IS THE ROAD TO HELL.” Upon which guitars, played by both Rea and Robert Ahwai, scream out jagged, torrid lines which have much more to do with Neil Young than with Knopfler. Always on this album the guitars sound as though in insurmountable pain. BACKGROUND II Chris Rea did not actually buy a guitar until he was in his early twenties; a late time to start. He taught himself to play it. Although influenced by his parents’ opera and light classical records, as a musician his main influences came from the blues, notably Sonny Boy Williamso, Charley Patton and Blind Willie Johnson; contemporary guitarists he admired included Ry Cooder and Joe Walsh. Although The Beautiful Losers were voted Best Newcomers in the Melody Maker poll of 1975, he had already been signed as a solo artist to Magnet Records the year before by the label’s head of A&R, Pete Waterman, but had to wait until 1978 before “Fool (If You Think It’s Over)” became a Billboard Top 20 hit. In Britain it missed the charts entirely on its first release and only scraped into the Top 30 upon reissue; it wasn’t until Elkie Brooks’ 1982 hit cover of the same song that the UK really began to pay attention to Rea’s music. He spent much of the eighties steadily building up his profile, particularly on the Continent, where he was a huge star long before his UK breakthrough. Given, however, that whenever he hit big he felt obliged to conform to what other people expected of him, it is no surprise that, following serious illness in the early 2000s, Rea resolved to revert to the kind of music he wanted to make, since when he has re-established himself as a highly respected blues performer who continues to record and tour with great success. He comes home from work, and his young daughter is crying over something they’ve shown on the news. He is outraged – “This ain’t even dinner time!,” “What’s wrong with you?,” “You don’t have to show that stuff/Can’t you show us some RESPECT?,” and threatening “I wish you were here”s. He concludes, chillingly, “You must be evil” – a warped and twisted media ready to make children cry and a nation collapse (“You giving out some bad ideas here”). “Looking For A Rainbow” grinds on for an agonising eight minutes and twenty seconds; he and his family have come down to the valley (of the shadow of death?) to seek their fortune – or so it would seem, because as the song progresses their real mission becomes clearer, “Maggie’s little children.../looking for Maggie’s farm” are actually here to exact their revenge... “You can’t leave us dying this time ‘Cos we’re all around your door” Between 2008-10 it was erroneously stated in some newspapers that Chris Rea had donated large sums of money to the Conservative Party and that he had been a long-time Conservative supporter. What the newspapers had done was to confuse him with another Chris Rea, a Sheffield businessman who is Group Managing Director of mechanical seal manufacturers AESSEAL and who had indeed donated money to the Conservatives. Although I note the strong work ethic that comes from growing up in an Italian family – and I should know – I am also aware that no one could have made a record like The Road To Hell and be a Conservative. Instead, in the album sleeve, Rea acknowledges “Everyone in all the governments.” Given that he values personal freedom and driving in particular, however, it is perhaps best to view the record as the rueful reflections of a disappointed small-c conservative, much in the vein of disappointed literary socialists such as Orwell, Huxley and Koestler. In “Your Warm And Tender Love,” he succeeds in finding refuge from the growing storm in love, the light which pierces all darkness. By the time of “I Just Wanna Be With You,” however, his need is turning into an obsession. “I just wanna be with you,” he reiterates, over and over, “’til the final curtain falls” and as an alternative to “know[ing] nothing at all.” “I know there’s a price to pay for doing what we do,” he cryptically admits, but that is no deterrence to their doing it. “That’s What They Always Say” is a sardonic rejoinder to those who talk all the time about getting away, making the break from the rat race, but who in their hearts know they’ll stay right where they are, gambling on that golden bridge just around the corner, “always one more thing to do.” But finally there is the realisation that there is no escape from this voluntary self-imprisonment. “The money junkie fades away,” remarks Rea, perhaps aware that he too will opt to hang on. But there are those dreams, the dreams of “Texas.” As the skies of Britain collapse around him and his wife (“Been watching some TV...It’s all gone crazy”) he fantasises about a place that priorities quarterbacks over quarterlights – “Warm winds blowing/Heating blue sky/And a road that goes forever.” Yet he concludes: “Watch me walking.” If he gets there, however, he’ll drive in his “Daytona,” a tribute to the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona classic car, which ceased production in 1973 but of which he still dreams exquisitely (“Twelve wild horses in silver chains/Calling out to me”). As with the “sweet angel” in “I Just Wanna Be With You,” he implores the Daytona to “shine your light on me.” Because nothing could be darker than this. It is almost the end of the record, this story of the mad dreams of the man stuck in his car who, for the second time, comes home to find his daughter – by 1989 Rea had two young daughters; nowhere are you really made to forget that this record is the work of a parent – watching television. And now, it is about abuse, and it is about violence and death – and beyond outrage, the narrator is at a loss what to say. “Grandpa says they’re happy now” – this is a song which involves three generations. He knows what grandpa is saying, and why he’s saying it, but he can’t find it in himself to believe it- Max Middleton’s string section freezes on the word “ice.” She is asking him, his little girl, to tell her that there’s a heaven, that these people will go somewhere, because otherwise why is she seeing all of this? He freezes and the strings descend into mild discordance before again settling. He turns to us for an answer: “So do I tell her that it’s true? That there’s a place for me and you?” But you can tell – “every painful crack of bones” – that he can’t tell her this story. The key line is: “What makes those men do what they do?” ...and you could say that this tale, this Then Play Long story, has been heading towards this conclusion all along, that the fundamental problem is not simply a question of why men do what they do, but the question of what constitutes evil. Because the closing vocal section of this song is truly terrifying, as the timpani rolls and the camera pulls back – “And I’m looking at the father and the son” as though the end credits are rolling, “And I’m looking at the mother and the daughter” – and then the strings become atonal again, with a thudding timpani heartbeat, as he sings “And I’m watching them in tears of pain/And I’m watching them suffer/DON’T TELL THAT LITTLE GIRL/TELL ME.” And then he sings the chorus again, but this time he’s the one asking, desperate to be convinced that it’s true, that some redemption must exist somewhere. The orchestra plays out as though this were a Lloyd Webber musical, and after some “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina” oboe flourishes, the song, and the record, and its decade, are all laid to rest. There is nothing left save the silence. The question is not just how a record like this ever got to number one, but what it means in greater terms. We closed down the sixties with “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” saw out the seventies with “I Was Only Joking,” and now we are nearly done with the eighties, by way of its epitaph. But with “Tell Me There’s A Heaven” in particular – one of this tale’s key songs – there is the sense of a greater and more horrific truth being revealed, and revelation is perhaps the last thing that needed to be done, since it all seems to have happened, as the book title goes, in plain sight. Here we are at the end of a decade whose number one albums have nearly all been about the problems faced by men and women and/or lovers in communicating with each other, and it ends, to all intents and purposes, with the notion that it is the medium itself which is the true evil, a declaration of intent by somebody – Rea in 1989 was thirty-eight years old – who has lived through all of Then Play Long and knows the whole story. The story of pop and rock music only really concerned with alerting its very young audience to an adult world. An era which may prove to be, as the Descendants have it, rotten to the core. And you realise why Rea might have been so keen to get his wife and kids over to Texas – as Americans glance at them on their long, endless highways and retort: “well, why do you think we left Britain in the first place?” – or anywhere that’s far, far away from evil people like Thatcher, Savile, Sutcliffe, Gadd, a country rotting because of its very own and deeply perverted traditions. And yet there is still hope. The half-Scottish Joe Strummer pointedly called his best  song “This Is England.” And while many might still view the road to Budapest as the road to Hell, maybe that signifies a major turnaround in how people are prepared to act towards their fellow humans. Perhaps the corporate media’s bluff has been fatally called; get away from television, newspapers, the internet, and realise that you can still make your own decisions about how the world operates. Strip away the neoliberal gaffa tape and you’ll find ordinary, generous and welcoming people beneath. CONCLUSION As the cover of this album clearly demonstrates, our world doesn't have to be compacted into profitable garbage like a spent car, and even in the darkest of corners, there always lurks a rainbow.

Nor indeed from Heaven 17, with the useless credit jamming up the roads. “Look out world, take a good look What comes down here You must learn this lesson fast And learn it well” If the second part of “The Road To Hell” predicates anything, it’s Leonard Cohen’s “The Future” from three years later. Possibly the most depressing thing about the latter song is how painfully accurate all his predictions have turned out to be – “Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima” indeed. I don’t know whether Cohen ever heard “The Road To Hell” but I do know that before going solo, Chris Rea played in a band called The Beautiful Losers. “This ain’t no upwardly mobile freeway OH NO, THIS IS THE ROAD TO HELL.” Upon which guitars, played by both Rea and Robert Ahwai, scream out jagged, torrid lines which have much more to do with Neil Young than with Knopfler. Always on this album the guitars sound as though in insurmountable pain. BACKGROUND II Chris Rea did not actually buy a guitar until he was in his early twenties; a late time to start. He taught himself to play it. Although influenced by his parents’ opera and light classical records, as a musician his main influences came from the blues, notably Sonny Boy Williamso, Charley Patton and Blind Willie Johnson; contemporary guitarists he admired included Ry Cooder and Joe Walsh. Although The Beautiful Losers were voted Best Newcomers in the Melody Maker poll of 1975, he had already been signed as a solo artist to Magnet Records the year before by the label’s head of A&R, Pete Waterman, but had to wait until 1978 before “Fool (If You Think It’s Over)” became a Billboard Top 20 hit. In Britain it missed the charts entirely on its first release and only scraped into the Top 30 upon reissue; it wasn’t until Elkie Brooks’ 1982 hit cover of the same song that the UK really began to pay attention to Rea’s music. He spent much of the eighties steadily building up his profile, particularly on the Continent, where he was a huge star long before his UK breakthrough. Given, however, that whenever he hit big he felt obliged to conform to what other people expected of him, it is no surprise that, following serious illness in the early 2000s, Rea resolved to revert to the kind of music he wanted to make, since when he has re-established himself as a highly respected blues performer who continues to record and tour with great success. He comes home from work, and his young daughter is crying over something they’ve shown on the news. He is outraged – “This ain’t even dinner time!,” “What’s wrong with you?,” “You don’t have to show that stuff/Can’t you show us some RESPECT?,” and threatening “I wish you were here”s. He concludes, chillingly, “You must be evil” – a warped and twisted media ready to make children cry and a nation collapse (“You giving out some bad ideas here”). “Looking For A Rainbow” grinds on for an agonising eight minutes and twenty seconds; he and his family have come down to the valley (of the shadow of death?) to seek their fortune – or so it would seem, because as the song progresses their real mission becomes clearer, “Maggie’s little children.../looking for Maggie’s farm” are actually here to exact their revenge... “You can’t leave us dying this time ‘Cos we’re all around your door” Between 2008-10 it was erroneously stated in some newspapers that Chris Rea had donated large sums of money to the Conservative Party and that he had been a long-time Conservative supporter. What the newspapers had done was to confuse him with another Chris Rea, a Sheffield businessman who is Group Managing Director of mechanical seal manufacturers AESSEAL and who had indeed donated money to the Conservatives. Although I note the strong work ethic that comes from growing up in an Italian family – and I should know – I am also aware that no one could have made a record like The Road To Hell and be a Conservative. Instead, in the album sleeve, Rea acknowledges “Everyone in all the governments.” Given that he values personal freedom and driving in particular, however, it is perhaps best to view the record as the rueful reflections of a disappointed small-c conservative, much in the vein of disappointed literary socialists such as Orwell, Huxley and Koestler. In “Your Warm And Tender Love,” he succeeds in finding refuge from the growing storm in love, the light which pierces all darkness. By the time of “I Just Wanna Be With You,” however, his need is turning into an obsession. “I just wanna be with you,” he reiterates, over and over, “’til the final curtain falls” and as an alternative to “know[ing] nothing at all.” “I know there’s a price to pay for doing what we do,” he cryptically admits, but that is no deterrence to their doing it. “That’s What They Always Say” is a sardonic rejoinder to those who talk all the time about getting away, making the break from the rat race, but who in their hearts know they’ll stay right where they are, gambling on that golden bridge just around the corner, “always one more thing to do.” But finally there is the realisation that there is no escape from this voluntary self-imprisonment. “The money junkie fades away,” remarks Rea, perhaps aware that he too will opt to hang on. But there are those dreams, the dreams of “Texas.” As the skies of Britain collapse around him and his wife (“Been watching some TV...It’s all gone crazy”) he fantasises about a place that priorities quarterbacks over quarterlights – “Warm winds blowing/Heating blue sky/And a road that goes forever.” Yet he concludes: “Watch me walking.” If he gets there, however, he’ll drive in his “Daytona,” a tribute to the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona classic car, which ceased production in 1973 but of which he still dreams exquisitely (“Twelve wild horses in silver chains/Calling out to me”). As with the “sweet angel” in “I Just Wanna Be With You,” he implores the Daytona to “shine your light on me.” Because nothing could be darker than this. It is almost the end of the record, this story of the mad dreams of the man stuck in his car who, for the second time, comes home to find his daughter – by 1989 Rea had two young daughters; nowhere are you really made to forget that this record is the work of a parent – watching television. And now, it is about abuse, and it is about violence and death – and beyond outrage, the narrator is at a loss what to say. “Grandpa says they’re happy now” – this is a song which involves three generations. He knows what grandpa is saying, and why he’s saying it, but he can’t find it in himself to believe it- Max Middleton’s string section freezes on the word “ice.” She is asking him, his little girl, to tell her that there’s a heaven, that these people will go somewhere, because otherwise why is she seeing all of this? He freezes and the strings descend into mild discordance before again settling. He turns to us for an answer: “So do I tell her that it’s true? That there’s a place for me and you?” But you can tell – “every painful crack of bones” – that he can’t tell her this story. The key line is: “What makes those men do what they do?” ...and you could say that this tale, this Then Play Long story, has been heading towards this conclusion all along, that the fundamental problem is not simply a question of why men do what they do, but the question of what constitutes evil. Because the closing vocal section of this song is truly terrifying, as the timpani rolls and the camera pulls back – “And I’m looking at the father and the son” as though the end credits are rolling, “And I’m looking at the mother and the daughter” – and then the strings become atonal again, with a thudding timpani heartbeat, as he sings “And I’m watching them in tears of pain/And I’m watching them suffer/DON’T TELL THAT LITTLE GIRL/TELL ME.” And then he sings the chorus again, but this time he’s the one asking, desperate to be convinced that it’s true, that some redemption must exist somewhere. The orchestra plays out as though this were a Lloyd Webber musical, and after some “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina” oboe flourishes, the song, and the record, and its decade, are all laid to rest. There is nothing left save the silence. The question is not just how a record like this ever got to number one, but what it means in greater terms. We closed down the sixties with “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” saw out the seventies with “I Was Only Joking,” and now we are nearly done with the eighties, by way of its epitaph. But with “Tell Me There’s A Heaven” in particular – one of this tale’s key songs – there is the sense of a greater and more horrific truth being revealed, and revelation is perhaps the last thing that needed to be done, since it all seems to have happened, as the book title goes, in plain sight. Here we are at the end of a decade whose number one albums have nearly all been about the problems faced by men and women and/or lovers in communicating with each other, and it ends, to all intents and purposes, with the notion that it is the medium itself which is the true evil, a declaration of intent by somebody – Rea in 1989 was thirty-eight years old – who has lived through all of Then Play Long and knows the whole story. The story of pop and rock music only really concerned with alerting its very young audience to an adult world. An era which may prove to be, as the Descendants have it, rotten to the core. And you realise why Rea might have been so keen to get his wife and kids over to Texas – as Americans glance at them on their long, endless highways and retort: “well, why do you think we left Britain in the first place?” – or anywhere that’s far, far away from evil people like Thatcher, Savile, Sutcliffe, Gadd, a country rotting because of its very own and deeply perverted traditions. And yet there is still hope. The half-Scottish Joe Strummer pointedly called his best  song “This Is England.” And while many might still view the road to Budapest as the road to Hell, maybe that signifies a major turnaround in how people are prepared to act towards their fellow humans. Perhaps the corporate media’s bluff has been fatally called; get away from television, newspapers, the internet, and realise that you can still make your own decisions about how the world operates. Strip away the neoliberal gaffa tape and you’ll find ordinary, generous and welcoming people beneath. CONCLUSION As the cover of this album clearly demonstrates, our world doesn't have to be compacted into profitable garbage like a spent car, and even in the darkest of corners, there always lurks a rainbow.

A138,"Story highlights Russian military moves inside Syria continued to escalate Friday with the arrival of fighter jets Russia's defense minister said the recent Russian military buildup in Syria is ""defensive in nature"" 
In a ""constructive conversation,"" both Carter and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu agreed to ""further discuss mechanisms for deconfliction in Syria,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said in a statement, as the United States and its allies continue military operations against ISIS inside Syria. 

Shoygu told Carter that the recent Russian military buildup in Syria is ""defensive in nature"" and aimed at supporting Russian obligations to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a senior U.S. Defense official told reporters. 

The U.S. policy is that Assad, a close ally of Moscow, must leave office in order to resolve the years-long civil war, and U.S. officials have warily watched Russia's military support of the Syrian regime. 

However, with U.S. aircraft also operating in the country as America roots out ISIS, it is important that the two powers coordinate their military presence to avoid accidental encounters. 

An intelligence official called the Russian buildup in Syria ""significant"" and said it would represent ""the first major expeditionary force deployment"" outside the former Soviet space that Moscow has undertaken since the war in Afghanistan. 

Reports indicate the military buildup in Syria could consist of combat aircraft that are capable of striking ground targets, providing close air support and intercepting aircraft, and small numbers of main battle tanks and armored personnel carriers to transport troops to the battlefield. 

Moscow's ultimate intentions are unclear, but initial signs suggest a focus on providing air support to Syrian forces and to humanitarian relief operations. The U.S. also expects Russia to send a small presence of ground forces to support these operations. 

The intelligence official added that ""a challenge for Russia is maintaining a presence on the ground may require a robust force that could come in direct combat with various forces in the region."" 

The conversation between Carter and Shoygu seemed to differ somewhat from an earlier call this week between senior U.S. and Russian officials. 

On Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said he had spoken with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and was told Russian movements in Syria were being focused toward the battle against ISIS. 

""I'm not taking that at face value, because we look at the type of airplanes or the type of munitions and so forth, and it obviously raises much more serious questions about what is happening,"" Kerry told reporters Wednesday. 

Traveling in London on Friday, Kerry said the destruction of ISIS remains the top U.S. priority in Syria, but that the Obama administration was also committed to finding ""a political settlement with respect to Syria, which we believe cannot be achieved in the long term presence of Assad."" 

The calls are the first between the two defense officials since the U.S. suspended military conversations with Moscow in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement inside Ukraine. 

READ: Putin becomes a political punching bag in White House race 

Despite the calls between Kerry, Carter and their counterparts, State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner maintained on Friday that the communication did not signal a new phase in the relationship, and that high-level contact between the U.S. and Russian military on other matters ""still remains on hold."" 

Officials said the call was initiated at the request of the Russian government, and it raises questions of how imminent any Russian military action in Syria may be. 

A U.S. official told CNN Friday that four Russian Sukhoi ""Flanker"" jets have arrived in Syria. It is unclear how those aircraft will eventually be used in Syria. 

Prior to that development, the U.S. had observed eight Russian military helicopters at the airbase in Syria that Russia is beefing up, and seen Russia move tanks, mobile artillery and armored vehicles into the Middle Eastern nation. 

The defense official did not rule out future discussions between U.S. and Russian officials on Russian support missions for Assad, even though the U.S. opposes that support. 

While it is unclear what the next steps in the U.S.-Russian military relationship may be, the official said further talks would be aimed at trying to ""avoid any misunderstanding"" in that relationship.

A140,"Lr Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, of the Fox Lake, Illinois police, was shot dead Tuesday morning The suspects in the shooting have been described as three men - two white and one black  Law enforcement scoured the area where the officer's body was found on Tuesday, but did not find the men The search for the suspects continued overnight Tuesday into early Wednesday morning    
As a small northern Illinois community mourned a popular veteran police officer who was fatally shot while on duty, authorities scoured the area overnight in search of three men wanted in his slaying. 

Helicopters were to aid about 100 officers early Wednesday as the manhunt in and around the village of Fox Lake for the suspects the fatal shooting of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz stretched toward a second day, a sheriff's office spokesman said. 

Authorities from across the state and region poured into the village about 60 miles north of Chicago after the shooting Tuesday morning, some wearing tactical gear and toting high-powered rifles. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the search for the suspects, Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli said.  

   
   
The search for three men who allegedly shot dead a police officer in Fox Lake, Illinois on Tuesday continued over night. Above, police helicopters with search lights scour the area where the three men disappeared  
   
Authorities from across the state and region poured into the village about 60 miles north of Chicago after the shooting Tuesday morning

Supporters hold signs as police continue searching for suspects in the shooting of a police officer Tuesday, September 1, 2015 in Fox Lake, Ill. Fox Lake Police Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewitz was shot and killed while pursuing a group of suspicious men 
 
Officers could be seen taking up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks, scanning the terrain with rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. Residents were urged to stay indoors, and schools were put on lockdown. 

Authorities said Gliniewicz radioed in Tuesday morning to tell dispatchers he was chasing three men on foot in Fox Lake. Communication with him was lost soon after. 

'His backup arrived shortly thereafter and found him injured with a gunshot wound,' Covelli said. Gliniewicz died of his injuries, Covelli said. 

An emotional Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend, a three-decade member of the department and a father of four sons. 
 
'We lost a family member,' Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as 'GI Joe.' ''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.' 

The area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. 

Authorities urged residents throughout the area to stay home while they conducted the search for three men, two of them white and the other black, aided by the canines and helicopters. 

The service of a local commuter train was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay in their homes — with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers.

Several schools were placed on lockdown as a precaution Tuesday, according to Schmit. And on Wednesday, seven area schools canceled classes, Covelli said. 

Gliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. 

Around Fox Lake, residents expressed their own sorrow over the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. 

'This particular officer is a pillar in my community and definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,' said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher who lives in the community. 

Dozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. 

Thirty-year-old Dan Raminick held a sign that said 'Police Lives Matter.' He lives a couple miles away and said officers came by Tuesday evening and thanked the crowd. 

Caitlyn Kelly, a 22-year-old student, said she felt compelled to come out after other recent police shootings. She held a sign that said 'Blue and Brave.'

A142,"Dallas star Linda Gray has said she is happy to live her life as a single woman. 
 
She told Hello! magazine: “A lot of women are content on their own and don’t want a partner. They want their freedom. We all love to flirt, it doesn’t mean you’re going to bring the person home or have a sleepover.” 
 (Hello! Magazine/PA)  
She also spoke about her previous marriage of 21 years to art director Ed Thrasher and her struggle to live her dream of being an actress. 
 
“I don’t like the word abusive because he was just living the life he knew how to live,” she says. 
 
“He was a creative guy and part of his dream was that he wanted to be a cowboy and run a ranch with horses, so when the children were little, we moved out here (to the house they designed and built together) and he had his horses and chickens. 
 
“Then when I announced I wanted to live my dream, the answer was, ‘No. You’ll become an actor when the children are in college.’ I thought, ‘My God, we’re living his dream, but what about mine?’ Of course, women stayed at home and raised their children – that was the way it was – but I was like, ‘Is that all there is?’.” 
 (Hello! Magazine/PA) 
She says landing the role of Sue Ellen Ewing in Dallas “opened so many doors, philosophies and ideas”. 
 
“All of us – Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, myself – were unemployed actors who happened to get a job and that job was Dallas. We had no idea it was going to be successful, so we were like, ‘Oh, here we are, trying the best we can’.” 
 
Her co-star, Hagman, famous for playing JR Ewing, died in November 2012. 
 
“We laughed every day,” she said. “Every day was different and funny. He was a born entertainer. There was just magic that happened between us. You know when you meet someone and feel like you’ve known them forever? That’s what it was like.”

A144,"At his heaviest, Dawn Lerman’s dad was 450 lbs. He tried to lose weight all the time—every week, he engaged in a new diet, some more successful than others, but nothing stuck. 
 
“In every corner of our house, there was no wall space,” Lerman says. “[Each wall] was either lined from floor to ceiling with diet books or shirts that represented my dad’s different weights. There was a pile: 185, 195, 205, 215, 225.” 
 
Lerman, a nutrition expert, cooking teacher, and Upper West Side mom-of-two, reflects on her tumultuous childhood relationship with food and how it affected her relationship with her family in her recent memoir, aptly named My Fat Dad . In the book, she describes how her creative family—her mother and sister were actresses, and her father worked in advertising as a writer and creative director, responsible for iconic slogans such as “Leggo My Eggo” and “Fly the Friendly Skies”—was always obsessing over food, but never in a healthy way. Her dad would diet, then maybe eat an entire pizza, then switch diets, while her mom would prepare either processed foods or nothing at all. It was Lerman’s grandmother who showed Lerman that, when prepared correctly, food could be a source of joy rather than stress. 
 
Lerman’s grandmother, whom people called Beauty, cooked traditional Jewish meals and encouraged making food into art rather than temporary sustenance. She and Lerman would sit down for meals, and no matter what they’d cooked, it would be set out on a nice plate, perhaps served with tea, and the two would eat “like ladies.” 
 
“My grandmother really drilled it into my head that food is love, food is happiness, [and] everything has to have a smell,”   Lerman says. “If it smells, if it has an aroma—it’s going to transform your world.” 
 
Once Lerman’s family moved from Chicago when she was 9, and she left Beauty behind, it was harder to stay positive. But Beauty would send recipe cards to Lerman at her new home in New York City. 
 
“My grandmother’s recipe cards saved my life because it kept me from getting in trouble. Every week I had this purpose and this mission,” Lerman says. “I had to go home, I had my recipe cards, I had to cook them for my sister…and I knew I had to take care of myself because nobody else would.” 
 
Lerman combined teachings from all the cooks in her life, whether it be Beauty’s “throw it in” style or her baker Aunt Jeannie’s carefully-measured approach, to take care of her own family. Her memories of Jeannie’s healthy “swaps” (like switching butter with applesauce) helped inspire Lerman to start her nutrition awareness program, Magnificent Mommies , which offers workshops to create healthier lifestyles for young children and their adults. 
 
But despite food’s looming presence in her formative years, Lerman’s path to becoming a nutritionist wasn’t exactly direct. She went through several professions first, including acting, producing commercials, and working as a school drama therapist with kids who suffered from ADHD, depression, and low self-esteem. 
 
“While working at the school, I realized how important proper food choices were,” she says. “I worked with kids on the importance of food choices, made snacks with them, and helped parents to add nutrient-loaded food into their children’s diets and get rid of sugar preservatives and artificial additives.” However, it wasn’t until a couple of years later, when her dad was diagnosed with cancer, that Lerman went back to school to study nutrition. “I realized helping people heal through food choices was my true calling,” she says. 
 
This creative yet practical approach that Lerman brought to her students guides how she cooks for her own children, as well. On her daughter’s first day of preschool, Lerman noticed how many of her classmates were eating unhealthy snacks. She started a blog, “ Snacking Outside the Box ,” for sharing her healthy recipes and cooking tricks, and started to bring treats into her daughter’s classroom to show that healthy cooking could taste good. 
 
“My daughter went to a preschool on the border of Harlem where many of the kids had never seen edamame or an avocado,” she says. “We made guacamole and edamame hummus. By teaching them to cook, we turned thier yucks into yums.” 
 
After her blog gained traction, Lerman tried to sell it as a book idea. But the response she received was largely: “That’s not your story. We want to hear about your family.” So she began writing about growing up with her fat dad for the New York Times’   “Well” blog , and the posts formed the basis for the book. 
 
Lerman was a little hesitant to explore her relationship with her father. She sent him chapters after she’d finished writing them so he could look them over, and calls the process “nerve-wracking.” However, her father’s response after reading the book was: “You’ve come a long way baby,” a tagline he’d created for Virginia Slims. 
 
Lerman has found that her story resonates with many; she’s received letters from people all over the world who’ve had a grandmother like Beauty or who had a parent who wrestled with extreme dieting. 
 
“My story is everybody’s story, and it could be your story, so the most important thing is trying to create good food memories around your kids, and be aware of the message you send to your children,” Lerman says. “Instill a love for food: For buying food, making food, eating food, and valuing what it does for your body. What we put in our body is how we’re going to live our lives. You’ve got to treat your body well.”

That’s because this makeup artist has the ability to transform herself into any celebrity or character of her choice using makeup. 
 
Not everyone is this artistically gifted! 
 
The artist, from South Dakota, managed to transform herself into everyone from the toupée-wearing Donald Trump to Jack Sparrow from “Pirates of the Caribbean.” 
 
She even   channeled   Zooey Deschanel and looked exactly like her. Freaky. 
 
In a recent interview with Huffington Post , the Swift revealed, 
 
On average, I’d say it takes around 30-45 minutes [to complete the looks]. And I know that the looks aren’t perfect. The style is really theatrical and I don’t spend a ton of time on blending. I want to work on that in the future. But the challenge is just for fun. 
 
So far, Swift managed to rack up over 43,000 followers on Instagram. Check out her work below!

A146,"When the MacBook Air came out in 2008, it was considered the standard for ultra-portable notebooks. The MacBook Air took a couple years for commercial acceptance, but it took off in a way that nobody had ever expected. The MacBook Air led to the creation of the competing Intel Ultrabook, but none of the Intel or Windows-powered devices could come close to matching the Air’s success. 
 
Things have changed in the past couple of years and the MacBook Air may not be the unique device it used to be. Microsoft’s Surface Pro took a couple of generations to take off, but the Surface Pro 3, released in June of 2014, was the first device that was easily seen as a MacBook Air killer. Tech Times wrote an article last year on the topic. 
 
“It appears though that Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is being put in competition against Apple products such as the iPad and MacBook Air. Based on a few reviews gathered, Microsoft’s latest baby is a killer.” 
 
Then, there is the Dell XPS 13 , which Computerworld thought was a much better buy than the MacBook Air. 
 
“Dell’s new XPS13 is a MacBook Air killer that shoehorns a 13-inch screen into a bezel that would normally hold an 11-inch panel. The new laptop also features Intel’s new Broadwell U CPU and a high-resolution touch screen.” 
 
The main thing holding the Surface Pro 3 and XPS 13 back was the much-disliked Windows 8 operating system. However, now that both devices come with the much-acclaimed Windows 10, they continue to take away customers who would have normally purchased a MacBook Air. 
 
However, it’s not just Windows devices that are taking attention away from the MacBook Air. Earlier this year, Apple released the ultra-light 12-inch MacBook, which has a Retina screen (unlike the MacBook Air) and has an updated design. As BGR says, the device that may really kill off the MacBook Air is the iPad Pro , due to be announced this week. 
 
“Effectively, the iPad Pro could be turned into a MacBook killer, a product that would rival similarly sized MacBooks and other laptops. That’s assuming Apple and its partners can deliver on the software side.” 
 
The “software” side could be a huge issue, given that, unlike the MacBook Air, the iPad Pro won’t be running a full desktop operating system. However, iOS is more than adequate for many, who just need a device for word processing, Internet surfing, and multimedia capabilities. The MacBook Air will always have a place in technology history, even if it isn’t quite relevant like it was five years ago.

A147,"When your child is sick and needs a prescription medication , you need to know the correct dosage, how often to give it, if it should be taken with a meal and of course, the side effects .   
 
Yet, you probably never give much thought to what is actually in the medication and how it’s prepared. What may surprise you is that prescriptions can actually be customized for your child with a technology known as compounding. 
 
Find out what compound pharmaceuticals are, how they can help your child get well and what you need to do to make sure they’re safe. 
 
What are compound pharmaceuticals? 
Unlike medications from pharmaceutical manufacturers which are formulated only one way, compound pharmaceuticals use the same pure, active chemicals that are in FDA-approved medications and customize them so they are specifically suited for the patient. 
 
Fifty years ago, most prescription medications in the U.S. were compounded but as drug manufacturers started to make more medications that could help the general population, compounding became less common. 
 
Yet since the 1980s, studies have shown that about 5 percent of patients of all ages were not having their needs met by commercial medications. Since most pharmacies fill 400 prescriptions per day, on average, there has been a growing need. 
  More on this...   
“That’s 20 patients a day per pharmacy where their needs are not being met or they’re not being met the way they could be because the medication isn’t customized for them,” said Scott Karolchyk, vice president of formulations for QmedRx in Maitland, Flo. 
 
Today, the majority of medications for kids are compounded, especially those given to children in cardiology and neonatal departments in hospitals, Karolchyk said.   
 
A compound pharmacy can change the concentration or dosage, make a suspension liquid or add a flavor to make it more palatable. It can also help a child who needs a specific medication that is currently unavailable or off the market. 
 
For example, a compound pharmacy can work with the doctor to ensure that infants who are sensitive to a medication that contain several drugs  are treated with a medication that has minimal side effects, Karolchyk said. 
 
Likewise, a compound pharmacy can create a unique concoction by mixing two types of creams together for a skin condition, for example. A medication can also be reformulated to exclude an ingredient like gluten or a dye that a child is allergic or that a child can’t tolerate because of side effects. 
 
Is compounding safe? 
There have been concerns in recent years about the safety of compounding pharmacies after a 2012 incident where 750 people developed fungal meningitis or other infections and 64 died from contaminated steroids dispensed by the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. 
 
“They were essentially acting as a manufacturer under the disguise of a compounder so it was total neglect and certainly not a fair representation of the average compounder who genuinely cares about the patients,” said Blake Powers, chief operating officer for QmedRx. 

Unlike drug manufacturers who are regulated by the FDA, the compound pharmaceutical industry is regulated by individual states. Nevertheless, there are strict guidelines including two key standards that compounding pharmacies must follow. One is the United States Pharmacopeia for both sterile and non-sterile preparations and the other is “good compounding practices,” or rules and regulations that all states follow. 
 
In 2013, President Obama signed the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) into law. Under the law, compounding pharmacies are encouraged to register with the FDA. Once they do, they are classified as outsourcing facilities so they can sell bulk drugs to hospitals and healthcare centers for what’s known as “office use.” These pharmacies will also be subject to the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations and inspections by the FDA. 
 
Yet since the registration is voluntary, not all pharmacies will be regulated by the FDA. 
 
“The medical community’s hope is that it will become more and more safe as compounding pharmacies are treated like manufacturers,” Dr. Carlo Reyes, an emergency medicine physician and pediatrician at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
 
What you need to know 
If your child is prescribed a medication, ask your pediatrician if the medicine is necessary in that particular formulation. Also, if the only thing that is being changed is the flavor, find out if there is a way to make the medication more palatable without using a compound pharmacy. 
 
It’s also a good idea to check with your insurance company because some may not cover the medication or have stipulations about the specific formulation. 
 
Your doctor may have a relationship with a compounding pharmacy or may hand you the prescription and let you find one yourself. Either way, ask your pharmacist if they have had problems with the compounding pharmacy. You can also check the FDA’s website for inspections and recalls. 
 
To find a reputable compounding pharmacy in your area, search the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists and look for a pharmacy that holds accreditation from the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB), which only 2 percent do. 
 
“It proves that they are meeting or exceeding all the compounding standards and regulations to ensure that their products are quality and that they’re safe,” Karolchyk said.

A151,"An anti same-sex marriage group has marked Father's Day by releasing a video warning of the dangers of children growing up without Dads. 

An Australian anti same-sex marriage group has marked Father's Day by releasing a video warning of the dangers of children growing up without Dads.

The 60-second long Marriage Alliance commercial uses American statistics to back its claims that children without fathers are more likely to drop out of school, run away from home, be involved in crime and end up in prison.

It describes fathers as ""a girl's first love"" and ""a boy's first hero"", and ends with the message: ""Australia is facing same-sex marriage which rejects the necessity of fathers. Some children will never celebrate Father's Day.""

The video has already been seen more than 11,000 times after being posted to Facebook.

Marriage Alliance had urged supporters to share the clip as it wasn't certain TV stations would broadcast it.

Spokeswoman Sophie York said same-sex couples were deliberately denying children their fundamental right to have a male and female role model.

""Allowing same-sex marriage legitimises social engineering and promotes dysfunction and suffering for kids,"" she said.

""The powerful and well-funded LGBT rights lobby is so focussed on their cause, they either forget about the rights of children who are the innocent victims of an unnatural parental union.""

A Google search for the phrase ""statistics on children without fathers"" brings up a link to an American blog called Fatherhood Factor, which lists many of the same statistics used in the Marriage Alliance ad.

One statistic – that 80 per cent of rapists came from a fatherless home – is credited to a 1978 study that found ""80 per cent of rapists motivated with displaced anger come from fatherless homes"".

While the video did not mention divorce, death and other circumstances that might result in a child growing up without a father, Marriage Alliance said in its statement it did acknowledge those factors.

""But deliberately putting a child into fatherless parental arrangement as occurs with a same-sex relationship or a legalised same-sex marriage means putting that child at extreme risk,"" it said.

""It legitimises an increase in fatherless kids.""

However a 2014 review of social science literature into child wellbeing in same-sex parent families prepared for the American Sociological Association found ""a clear consensus... that American children living within same-sex parent households fare just as well as those children residing within different-sex parent households over a wide array of well-being measures: academic performance, cognitive development, social development, psychological health, early sexual activity, and substance abuse.""

It further stated: ""Differences that exist in child well-being are largely due to socioeconomic circumstances and family stability.""

A 2013 study on same-sex parented families by Child Family Community Australia (part of the federally-funded Australian Institute of Family Studies) concluded that research to date challenged the notion that they were harmful to children.

""Children in such families do as well emotionally, socially and educationally as their peers from heterosexual couple families,"" the report stated in its key messages.

""Some researchers have concluded there are benefits for children raised by lesbian couples in that they experience higher quality parenting, sons display greater gender flexibility, and sons and daughters display more open-mindedness towards sexual, gender and family diversity.""

Neither the Marriage Alliance commercial nor the media release made any mention of whether children who grew up with two male parents would receive extra benefits from having two fathers.

A152,"Petersburg area farmer Kurt Collins stripped the first reported bale of 2015-crop cotton in Hale County on Monday, with it being ginned about 3 p.m. Tuesday at Petersburg Co-op Gin. 
  
Collins grew the dryland crop about a mile west of FM 789 on the north side of FM 784, producing four modules and 40 to 45 bales of cotton. Yield was approximately one bale, or about 500 pounds of fiber, to the acre. 
 
He planted Fibermax 1830 in mid-May, and used a defoliant to prepare the crop for harvest. 
 
“We prepped it and then waited two weeks before harvest,” he reported. 
 
Collins, 39, started farming in 2004 and is completing his 11th crop. 
 
He and his wife, Tammi, have been married 11 years and are farming partners. 
 
“I was born and raised in Petersburg, and never left,” he explained Tuesday. He’s owned the parts store in Petersburg for the past 18 years, and lives nine miles north of Petersburg on FM 789. 
 
Kurt and Tammi Collins have two sons, Kutter, 8, a second grader, and Cooper, 14, a freshman at Petersburg High School.

BlackLivesMatter protesters take to the streets. 
 
The White House it seems held a private, quiet get-together with members of Black Lives Matter, a meeting that wrapped with key presidential adviser, Valerie Jarrett tweeting: Let’s do it again real soon. 
    
BuzzFeed News reported a senior administration official confirmed the activists met with President Obama’s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, deputy assistant for urban affairs Roy Austin and others employed in the administration on Wednesday. The Black Lives Matter group included Dream Defender’s Phil Agnew, Campaign Zero’s DeRay McKesson, Brittany Packnett and Johnetta Elzie, and Baltimore United for Change’s Jamye Wooten, the Hill reported.

And Jarrett herself tweeted a message: “#deray #Nettaaaaaaaa Looking forward to continuing our dialogue to ensure everyone is safe.” 
 
Colin Flaherty’s book, “Don’t Make the Black Kids Angry: The Hoax of Black Victimization and Those Who Enable It,” documents black crime in America and exposes how the media and politicians are willing partners in what the author calls “the greatest lie of our generation.” 
 
Packnett posted a picture of herself with Jarrett, above the tweeted text: “honest and action oriented. thank you continuing to engage w the movement. Valerie.” 
 
BuzzFeed reported they discussed law enforcement and community poicing issues during the gathering.

A156,"Nice of them to let us know they’re still as ludicrous and evil as ever Saturday, September 26, 2015 By Carlo Sands
A radical environmentalist plots her next extremist act. If you are reading this, you are clearly at high risk of “radicalisation” — a budding violent extremist probably only a few Triple J Hottest 100 tracks away from blowing up Parliament House, or at least picketing the offices of a classic FM station. You probably picked up a copy of this radical extremist rag from a dodgy-looking bloke who emerged from an alley saying: “Psst … you want a copy of Green Left Weekly or some MP3s of some real alternative shit? I got some full on folk punk protest stuff on here, plus a few leaflets for the upcoming anti-shark culling protest if you are after the really heavy shit…” The government’s Preventing Violent Extremism and Radicalisation in Australia “awareness kit”, which it sent to schools, has been widely mocked — not least for the absurd “case study” of “Karen” who went from “alternative music” to environmental extremism. But this is just the most ridiculous part of a sinister publication. Its attempt to demonise environmental activism is worrying, but the main target is the Muslim community — where the demonisation is far less cartoonish and more a lived experience in fear and bigotry. To grasp how little this “awareness kit” has to do with combating violence or national security, consider the fact that it was never even meant to be sent to schools. Its main authors had no idea that would happen: one did not know until the Guardian told them. It was pulled together as a guide for “professionals in communities”. Professor Gary Bouma, who is quoted extensively throughout, has repudiated the final document. It was twisted to be a school “awareness kit” — and promptly leaked to the Murdoch press, which obliged with screaming headlines. It was a cheap political stunt that had as much to do with genuine concern for “national security” as Tony Abbott has in not destabilising Malcolm Turnbull. Even Karen’s now world-famous story was severely twisted. A study author said Karen was a “well-known case study” who was “an example of someone who in fact did not radicalise”. Yet, she is highlighted in the section on “violent extremism”. This sleight of hand, in which “radicalisation” and “violent extremism” are used interchangeably, occurs throughout. The “Living Safe Together” website, tied to the kit, includes defending controversial government policies, such as towards Syria, to combat “radical” ideas. This is ironic considering bombing another country might be considered to be a somewhat extreme and violent act, but presumably only by those yet to be re-educa … engaged in a respectful dialogue aimed at preventing extremist conclusions like war breeds terrorism. Also ironic is that Professor Pete Lentini, who worked on the project, said its authors had intended “radical” as a neutral, technical term, referring to “a change in belief structure”. “I actually think, thank god for radicals, things like the suffragette movement, anti-slavery, and so on,” he told the Guardian. “And I actually got interested in the study of politics through alternative music.” Especially disturbing is the brochure’s constant counter-posing of “radicalisation” with the “mainstream” — as though the very act of holding a different idea is a matter of grave suspicion. Should anyone you know actually give voice to such views that fall outside the existing consensus, well, the brochure kindly provides the Terrorism Hotline at the back. How do you actually achieve any progress if anyone with views differing from the currently accepted wisdom is to be treated like a defendant in a medieval witch trial? After all, witch trials, slavery and 1980s hairstyles were all once entirely “mainstream”. The answer, presumably, is that even posing such a question requires an organised intervention that involves being locked in a room with only old Andrew Bolt columns to read until you capitulate. The reasons for the government’s political stunt are pretty obvious. Dedicated to dismantling the social safety net, stripping back hard-won working conditions and determined to turn the whole nation into an open-cut coalmine, “national security” is one of the only issues on which the Coalition feels it can connect with voters. This makes it all the more stunning that, on the back of the Border Farce debacle a few weeks back, they managed to screw it up so severely once again. Still, I suppose it was good of the justice minister and minister assisting the PM on counter terrorism, Michael Keenan, to prove that despite all the recent shake-ups, Tony Abbott’s spirit of sinister incompetence lives on.

A157,"FOX's Sleepy Hollow returns for a new season this week, and the season premiere features a face that will be familiar to TV fans. Actress Charlene Amoia endeared herself to audiences as the waitress Wendy on CBS's How I Met Your Mother , but now she's taking a completely different turn. 
 
Starpulse spoke to Charlene to discuss diving into  Sleepy Hollow and what it was like for her to be the titular character in the first new episode, ""I Witness."" It goes without saying that she's not just visiting town. 
 
""Season two has Ichabod [Tom Mison] and Abbie [Nicole Beharie] dealing with very different sets of dangers than we’ve seen in the last two seasons,"" Charlene explained. ""My character Susan James witnesses some dark things at work and is weighed down by the secrets she's keeping. With the help of Abbie and Ichabod she learns how to tackle the perils head on."" 

As for joining the Sleepy Hollow cast, ""It was the first episode back from hiatus so everyone was in good spirits and happy to be there,"" she told us. ""I really enjoyed talking with and getting to know Tom Mison and Nicole Beharie. They were both very sweet and lovely to work with."" 
 
Charlene also explained how she approaches a role like Susan, knowing that unlike the recurring part she had as Wendy, she's only going to have one episode to find and explore this character. 
 
""The writers are usually pretty good with wrapping up a character's story line within the episode, so I usually just focus on connecting into the circumstances and bringing in some added nuances to the role,"" she said. 
 
[embedded content] 
 
""I try not to get attached to wanting to be on any particular show and try to make decisions more on if the role speaks to me in some way. One of the things I ask when looking at material is, “Why is this material coming to me now?” and go from there."" 
 
Not that she wouldn't have welcomed more episodes with one of her past characters. ""I would have liked to do a few more episodes of Switched At Birth ,"" said Charlene, who played Diana Coto on the ABC Family series. 
 
""In my episodes my husband was cheating on me with an intern. It would have been cool to have been able to confront him and explore the strength of my character in that situation."" 
 
After Sleepy Hollow , you can find her more on the big screen. ""I have a couple thrillers coming out soon,"" she teased. "" Nefas: The Demon Within and Live-Evil are being released this year. 
 
""I also shot a feature called FAT alongside my friend Mel Rodriguez that premiered at TIFF and will now be released in select theaters. FAT is a film that addresses food addiction and mental illness in a way that I’ve never seen before.""

A160,"GMC Sports Information 
  
The Georgia Military College Bulldogs fell to visiting College of DuPage at home on Saturday. 
 
It was all DuPage to start out the game as they held Georgia Military College (GMC) to a 3-and-out and scored on their following drive on a 5-yard touchdown with 10:50 left in the first quarter to put DuPage on the board first 7-0. 
 
It was more of the same as DuPage held GMC to another 3-and-out and scored on another rushing touchdown, this time for 56 yards to put them up 14-0. 
 
After a couple of stalled out drives for both teams, DuPage scored once again on another rush touchdown increasing the number to a 79-yard touchdown, putting them up 21-0. 
 
GMC finally got on the board with a field goal from Evan Pantels to put the score at 21-3. 
 
The following drive DuPage converted for another rushing touchdown from 4 yards out after a big return to set up the score. 
 
After an interception thrown by GMC, DuPage scored on field goal and increased their lead to 31-3. 
 
To start the second half GMC came out strong on defense holding DuPage to no points, but on the Bulldogs’ following offensive drive they threw an interception returned for a touchdown, putting the score at 39-3 after the 2-point conversion. 
 
GMC kept fighting as David Mims intercepted the DuPage pass with 1:13 left in the third quarter. 
 
The Bulldogs closed the game out strong, playing good defense and stalling out a few DuPage drives, forcing a safety on a punt followed by a TD by Josh Nurse. 
 
DuPage ended the game with an interception and win with a final score of 39-12 in the opponent’s favor. 
 
GMC head coach Bert Williams had a few thoughts after the game.

“It was certainly a disappointing day for us all. We would have loved to pick up a win, but we ran into a very good program in DuPage College. Not taking anything away from them, but we were a bit dead-legged with the short preparation week. We will now have an open week were we can get rested, regroup and work on our areas that need improvement. We trust that our young guys will take some lessons away from this and get better. There is a lot of football left and we will be ready to go on Oct. 3 when we line it up against a very good program in Nassau Community College (N.Y.).”"

TAPING the show on Wednesday, Clinton asked Fallon if he'd ever touched Republican rival Donald Trump's hair before inviting him to touch her hair.

Fallon tugged her hair and declared it to be real.

Trump spent the evening taking part in a Republican debate, but references to him dominated Clinton's appearance with Fallon.

The show began with Fallon wearing a wig, impersonating Trump in a sketch.

Clinton said if Trump became president, she imagined he might rename the White House as the Trump House.

A162,"I’ve heard religion taught and grace preached.
But for many years the concept of grace was void of being able to help me understand how to live grace, in the tangledness of life.
Religion was a list of rules. It was black or white. Right or wrong. Them and us.
And grace, well, it didn't seem like a gift when the words preached built fences to keep some people in and others out. I thought Jesus was holding committee meetings in heaven about who had the correct doctrine. And there must be holy sub-committees who labored over deep issues such as music, how people should dress, programs, political association and other social issues of the day.
There were people, not so different from myself, messed up, carrying decades of burdens, trying to find the grace offered by Jesus, but who couldn't get past walls which held back hope.
There was always a lot of talk of grace, but it felt like barbed wire wrapped around my soul.
When grace is taught only as a religious concept, it shows up in our dealings and interactions with others.
Jesus experienced this as He walked on this earth. 
The very people God loved ––well they wanted their Messiah to come and save their people, but when He showed up they didn't like the way Grace looked. 
He didn't fit inside their neatly established boxes.   
The Torah (the Law) pointed to the coming Messiah. The oral law was added, and strangely enough is still referred to as, ""building a fence around the law.""  
By the time Jesus arrived on the scene, ""the fence"" included 248 extra commandments and 365 additional prohibitions. 
The oral law was intended to protect the Written Law. 
As a former rancher, I well know the value of a fence and how it's expressed purpose is to protect by restricting access.
What was intended to protect, became a stumbling block.
Jesus told the leaders of that day,  ""You load people down with rules and regulations, nearly breaking their backs, but never lift even a finger to help."" Luke 11:46
Those people wanted to kill Jesus, because they felt they were the final authority on who had access to God.  
He broke their rules. He didn't play within the boundaries of  who, what, when, where and how their Messiah was suppose to do things.
Despite the opinions of those leaders, the religious elite, the ones who had the keys to the church building, Jesus was scandalous in His love for others. 
He was known to hang out with prostitutes, thieves, the passed-over, used up, the shunned, and the lowest-of -the-low in that society.  
Because Good News is mostly received by those who are used to bad news.
Jesus lived as an equal-opportunity-grace-extender and the religious men with their protective fences of rules, well they wanted to kill Him for it. In fact they did kill Him and that is how Grace became our Gift.
Jesus came knowing He would be rejected by the very ones He came to save. 
It was true then and is still true today, men and women like to add incredible yokes of bondage and spiritual slavery to people. Perhaps, without meaning to, we can make claims to be the absolute authority of who should have access and who shouldn't. All while we miss the heart of those looking for Jesus, because we miss the very heart of Jesus Himself.
Not everyone has an open heart for His wild grace.
I came to my own crisis of faith. 
The Jesus I read about, the One I wanted to live for, wasn't the One I saw people in church living. In fact it was all in direct conflict with each other. 
One day I sat in a heap and told God and my husband, "".......if  religion and rules and arguments about doctrine is all Jesus is about, then I'm done with it.""
It was  lifeless and above all loveless to me. 
Crazy thing.... the very same day I walked away from religion, Jesus showed up. 
Grace isn’t found within human lines. 
Grace is found in the fullness and abundance of Christ. 
Grace is a Person. 
Grace is what sets us apart from all other religion.
For by grace you have been saved through faith.  And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,  not a result of works, so that no one may boast.  Ephesians 2: 8-9 Grace is simple in the fact that it is found in Christ alone. 
That Savior, the One who created the entire universe, a macrocosm which cannot contain Him ––He is wild, complex and sets His own boundaries, which are wide and spacious.  Jesus is supreme and He is the One who establishes how far the oceans can go, the rising and setting of the sun.  He had a way of breaking people’s rules and turning over tables.  Jesus was and is famous for welcoming God-seekers that look more like castaways. He summons the weary and wrecked. The restless and the prodigal. 
He didn't come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. 
God’s law is to be INTERNALIZED. It isn't a set of external things we do or rules we keep. It changes us from the inside out ––truly it's upside down, to how rules and religion work.
We who love God, obey Him. Not out of coercion or boundaries set, but because of the great grace.
He doesn't tell us to get cleaned up and then come to Grace, He invites us to come and be changed by grace.
What I know is that grace, His grace, has brought me salvation and much more. 
Because of who Jesus is, the same grace that saves us, settles over all of our messy, cracked places and continues to mark and change us. Grace is a very multi-faceted thing. It is the Gift as well as the Restorer, Game Changer, Forgiver, Peace Maker, Rescuer, Giver of all good things.
It changes stone hearts into hearts of flesh.
The more time we spend with Grace the more we begin to look and live like grace.
When we are living grace, it brings wild freedom and reckless passion. 
Grace gives us eyes to see things which graceless eyes cannot see. 
Such as people who haven't got set free from their chains yet.
I love our church and all the messy people in it. Together we are growing, pressing in, allowing more Grace into the places that still need,,,, more grace.
The authenticity of our faith will always, always, be marked by deeply warm grace. That is how we live this tangled messy life.

A163,"There is something amazingly symbolic about Congress considering the Obama- Khamenei agreement on the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attack. 

Virtually every lesson Americans learned painfully that day has been forgotten in the rush to sign an agreement with the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. 

Fourteen years ago, the World Trade Center collapsed, the Pentagon was hit and a fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania. The nation was horrified and enraged. 

We learned that we could be surprised. 

We learned that our enemies hated us and wanted to kill us. 

We learned that our enemies were good at long term planning and at deception. 

We learned once again that the military and intelligence communities play a vital role in keeping us safe. 

Now, 14 years later, the president and his allies are ignoring every one of these lessons. 

They are pushing for an agreement that assumes we can trust our mortal enemies and that assumes paper treaties and international bureaucrats can keep us safe. 

They are pressuring their elected allies to side with them in this surrender to the Ayatollah Khameini even when those allies know it is a terrible and dangerous idea. 

Forget the harsh language of the opponents. Listen to what the supporters of the deal are saying. 

First, our “partner” in this agreement, Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei , on Wednesday reminded us that he views America as “the Great Satan” and vowed that Israel will be eliminated within 25 years. He said : 

[Ayatollah] Khomeini called America ‘the Great Satan.’ That is a very wise saying … Satan only deceives man, but the U.S. deceives, murders, and imposes sanctions … After the nuclear talks were over, I heard that the Zionists in occupied Palestine had said: ‘In the meantime, thanks to the results of the talks, we will have 25 years of quiet regarding the problem of Iran. After 25 years, we will think of something.’ I respond to them by saying: ‘First of all, in 25 years you will not be alive.’…God willing, in 25 years there will be no such thing as the Zionist regime in the region, and secondly, during this period, the fighting Islamic spirit will not give the Zionists even a single day of serenity…” 

When the leader you are trying to trust tells you before the agreement is ratified that he will destroy Israel and he will continue to preach “Death to America,” you have to wonder what he will say after it is approved.

A164,"READING reports about many Malaysians, especially young people, being declared bankrupt is both frightening and sad. These people do not realise that being declared a bankrupt is like being given a life sentence. 
 
Even though they are able to discharge themselves later, the record of their bankruptcy will still appear in the systems of the credit information and rating companies, and this can create obstacles to those who need to secure loans to buy property or to open a business. 
 
The current economic situation warrants people to be careful in their financial commitments and expenditure. It is better to be careful now than to regret it later, especially among young people. 
 
I also hope for changes to be made in the conditions for declaring a person bankrupt. 
 
In fact, the current figure of RM30,000 that would cause a debtor to be declared a bankrupt is too low to ruin a person’s life, especially a young one. 
 
I wonder when this figure was set. The amount should be higher in line with the current standard of living. 
 
In Malaysia, unless you are able to pay off your debts or if the creditors are prepared to release you, you will remain a bankrupt for the rest of your life. 
 
My wife’s friend was made a bankrupt together with her husband more than 35 years ago. Her husband passed away 30 years ago and until today she is still a bankrupt. She is required to seek permission from the bankruptcy office to travel overseas for holidays even though the expenses are paid by her children. 
 
She applied for a discharge on many occasions but the creditors disagreed. She is 70 years old now and it looks like she will die a bankrupt. 
 
If I am not mistaken, in Hong Kong, a bankrupt who has not previously been adjudged bankrupt and who has fully complied with the provisions under the Bankruptcy Ordinance, will be automatically discharged from bankruptcy four years from the date of the Bankruptcy Order provided that there is no objection from the creditors or the trustee. 
 
I hope the relevant authorities will review our bankruptcy laws to give former bankrupts the opportunity to rebuild their lives. 
 
They should look at raising the amount of debt and length of time a person should be a bankrupt. 
 
Also, once a person is discharged, all records pertaining to his bankruptcy must be erased. 
 
The credit information and rating companies should not be allowed to include this information in their systems as this will cause unnecessary inconvenience and obstacles in the former bankrupt people’s efforts in rebuilding their lives.

A165,"Volcano and Crater Hike 
 
This Volcano De San Salvador has a beautiful green crater and the pleasant hike and surrounded by lush green trees.  Benjamin specializes in bird watching and brought a telescope to point out several in the tress for us to get an up close look at. We then went and had a fantastic meal at La Pampa Restaurant. 
 


Prawns and Steak Meal 
 I had a very tender steak and several large prawns cooked in garlic. La Pampa Restaurant has several locations around the country you will pass on your travels and I would recommend you have more than one meal there. They are open for lunch and dinner. The next morning after breakfast at the hotel we got in our van and Benjamin and our driver Miguel drove the 4 of us on a 2 hour drive to the Puerto Barillas Marina and Lodge  . 


Black Jesus Mural 
 
Along the scenic drive we visited a few charming  towns that are famous for their beautifully decorated ruralist painted murals as well as stopping along the side of the road to get fresh cashews and a variety of sweet fruit. A local favorite is a fresh coconut, drink the water then eat the meat, a perfect healthy snack for the drive. 
 


Fresh Fruit Roadside 
 
Throughout the country they have a bounty of tasty bananas, pineapple, coconuts, mangos and several other exotic fruits you have never heard of so give them a try. You'll find several exotics as drinks in the restaurants as well. I enjoyed the Hibiscus juice with a meal. 
   


Fresh Coconut Roadside 
 


Marina Lodge Bungalow 
 The Puerto Barillas Marina and Lodge is charming in its individual bungalows set in the trees and their outdoor covered restaurant is a five minute walk from your room and right on the water.    


Relaxing At Puerto Barillos Marina Lodge 
 
The Lodge is part of the unspoiled Bahia De Jiquilisco biosphere reserve. Here at the lodge you can book many tours including a guided Kayak Tour through the mangroves where many colorful birds, fish and crocodiles live. It is a great way to start the morning after breakfast. I really loved their Spider Monkey Sanctuary Tour where we fed them bananas as they descended from the trees above us. 
 


Feeding The Wild Monkeys 
 


Mommy and Baby 
 
During the civil war the fighters living in the jungle killed most all of the country's monkeys for food. This sanctuary is now the only place you can see and interact with them in the entire country. We started our days early because in the rainy season it usually rains around 5 pm for an hour or two. 
   


Our Turtle Adventure Boat 
 Next the lodge took us on a Sea turtle Conservation Tour to visit the Turtle Hatchery and have lunch. We boarded a local boat which took us through the mangroves to a local waterfront dock for a nice red snapper lunch. The fish were caught that morning by the local fisherman.  


Local Boys Enjoy A Swim 
 


Red Snapper Lunch 
 
Young boys played in the water around the dock as we ate. The Turtle Hatchery is run by ICAPO charity and is set up to protect and repopulate the highly endangered Hawksbill Turtle. 
 


Turtle Hatchery 
 
The hatchery is run by a youngish 20's group of trained dedicated volunteers, who work with the locals and pay them by the eggs that they find. The local fisherman report around the clock no matter the time of night where they've spotted the turtles in the act of laying eggs and let the trained staff move in and remove the buried eggs into the protected hatchery. Sometimes the locals just bring the new eggs right to the Hatchery but that is not ideal since they are very fragile. Up until 2009 it was legal to eat turtle eggs and locals love the treat, so this was causing the turtle population to vanish. Now with this successful program and locals on board to help they have been able to release each season 40,000 to 50,000 new turtles into the water safely.   This tour and lunch cost a group up to 6 people $230. Only around $40 per person. Our tour concluded with a Rodeo Capture of a turtle in the bay. The staff if they can spot a turtle will have local fisherman surround it with a fishing net, the turtle gets curious and come to the net. The staff get in the water and then bring the turtle onto your boat. Here they can measure its size, scrape a small skin sample for DNA and tag the turtle. 
 


One Big Turtle Onboard 
 
On our trip they pulled a huge 200 pound turtle into our boat and it was very exciting. They put a wet cloth over turtles eyes to keep it calm. Within a few minutes the work was done and the turtle was back in the water off swimming away. 
 


Spotted Eagle Ray 
 The staff also grabbed a beautiful spotted stingray caught in the net which they held up for us to admire before releasing it safely back into the water. To learn more about their work visit ICAPO site .   The highlight of the trip for me was the Turtle and Spider Monkey Tours which you book through the lodge. Both were highly educational and thrilling to be a part of. The Marina and Lodge offer so much more from great fishing tours, sailing, bird watching and bike riding . That evening while rain poured down we enjoyed in our air conditioned bungalow a terrific dinner, (chicken, fish or steak) with apple pie and ice cream. And yes the water is fine in El Salvador so we ate salad and fruit that was washed and nobody got sick on the trip. You can brush your teeth with tap water in the hotels. All the hotels we stayed in were well air conditioned, making for a great nights sleep. And they use American money so no need here to change currency on arrival. The next morning we headed out early again for a 3 hour drive to an organic Indigo farm. All along our drives we saw horses and cattle off to the side of the road and lots of local friendly dogs. Surprisingly there aren't many goats in the country.    


Simple Life 
   


Local Improvised Buses 
 
There are many regular buses for locals to get around but in the small towns we also saw converted trucks which serve locals with a stand up open air ride for the price of a quarter. Driving around the country i noticed that every Gas Station which also had a air conditioned 7-11 like convenience store attached had a hired private security armed guard out front. This keeps would be criminals away. There is a lot of poor on poor crime so all nice restaurants as well have armed security out front that way they discourage problems. 
 


Armed Guards At Gas Stations 
 Hacienda Los Nacimientos  is one of only 2 certified Organic Indigo Farms in the world . Owner Rhina deRehmann  will give you a wonderful and educational tour of her farm and show you how they take the indigo from the plant  through the washing process and into that spectacular blue color dye. She then ships her entire inventory to Turkey where The Gap, Levi's and Bennetonturn it into children's jeans and jackets. Going organic means there are no allergy problems. But being organic is much harder and of course much more expensive. Rhina is very proud of their work. As her farm grows they are employing more locals which is great for the community.  


Washing the Organic Indigo 
 
Indigo is the most famous of all dyes and the hardest to get just right. It is the only dye that doesn't fade in sunlight. You will learn how the plant is grown then cut, and the seeds collected. They export 800 kilos of Indigo this year have have requests for double that amount. 
 


Create Your Own Indego Scarfs 
 
The tour includes each visiting member a lesson on how to dye a white scarf with the blue indigo and using marbles and other small wood blocks you will create your own design. It is a great souvenir from your tour. The farm also grows cashews and makes cashew wine. 
   


Papusas Lunch 
 
All throughout the country including here at the indigo farm Pupusas is the local snack or a quick lunch . They are made with pork or beef, a popular one is filled with cheese and beans, some are made with a local flower and with all you get a side of tomato sauce to dip them in. The cost from a quarter to seventy five cents each. We enjoyed a Pupusas lunch with Rhina and her husband. 
   


White Church 
 Back on the road we headed to the small town of Suchitoto  with it's beautiful white church. This town had the nicest hotel in the entire country, Los Almendres de San Lorenzo . A wonderful mix of Spanish hacienda with a Moroccan influence. The owners spend many years living in Europe and brought spectacular furnishings with them.  


Loved My Two Story Villa 
 


Hotel Pool and Restaurant 
 
My two level suite slept four, had a beautiful balcony overlooking the mountains and lake in the distance. I enjoyed a nice swim in the hotel pool, watched colorful geckos and birds abound the lush plants that line the hotel. We had a wonderful dinner that night in the Hotel restaurant. That afternoon after shopping in the town for local handmade souvenirs and we explored the towns dramatic large white church. El Salvador is a very catholic country.  
 


Amazing Grilled Lunch 
 


Cozy Charming Cafe 
   


Beautiful Cafe View 
 
The next day we were back on the road for a few hour drive to explore 2 Mayan Ruin Archaeology sites of Joya de Ceven and  Cihvatan. There are 4 major Mayan Ruins and all can be seen in one day of driving around. At Joya de Ceven we saw the remains of a Mayan village that was buried below in 20 feet of Volcanic rock and ash from the Volcano eruption (think Pompeii) and sat undiscovered for close to a 800 years till a construction crew digging for a building project in the 1970's hit into a base of a Mayan house.   
 


Mayan House Ruins 
 


1000 Year Old Mayan Family House 
 
At this site you will see how the family lived, slept, cooked. And there is an interesting Shaman house and community building for ceremonies. There is a sauna or hot house remains, and one that has been fully reconstructed for you to see how it looked back in the day. In the museum here you will see the Mayan pottery, jewelry, plus black volcanic carved spear heads for hunting. They even have the fossil of a duck that was tied to a string left at the family house when the villagers fled before the Volcano erupted. 
   


1000-1500 Year Old Mayan Temple 
 
A short 40 minute ride took us to a spectacular Mayan temple at Cihvatan . Here going back 1500 years they built 4 temples each on top of the other. The first one is so old it is now completely under the earth. The other 3 temples are spectacular to see. There is a huge green grass field next to the temple where the warriors played a soccer like game now called The Ball Game .  They used a rubber ball about 20 inches, the goal of the game was to pass the ball around without it touching your hands, and get ball to pass thru one of the rings which were very high on a stone wall.. Not always but sometimes the winning team was then sacrificed, put to death at the temple. The logic was that the best warriors needed to die to enter the underworld and fight the demons that were causing all the hardship here on earth to the village.  They assumed the volcano eruptions were the Demons acting up.

 We had a our last dinner at the terrific El Jardin de Celeste . Known as one of the best restaurants in the country I had great veal shank while others opted for the famous steaks. Everyone was very happy we came here. Like many of the country restaurants it was open air but covered from the sun and rain. The restaurant had some wonderful flowers and gardens.

 We slept our last night at Casa Degraciela  a very nice Boutique Hotel in the town of Ahuachapan .  This was a very charming town for shopping and like all the towns shuts down early around 8 pm on weeknights. The walls were thin and I was able to hear others outside but after a full day on the road I had no problem sleeping in my air conditioned room.   
Our last afternoon before heading to the airport we headed up the winding mountain road and visited Cerro Verde a spectacular Volcano  park which offers very nice 2 hour hiking tour of the volcano.

A166,"A billionaire politician under investigation for corruption in Malaysia faces allegations his family companies have laundered millions of dollars through the Australian real estate market. A billionaire politician under investigation for corruption in Malaysia faces allegations his family companies have laundered millions of dollars through the Australian real estate market. The allegations against the family of Sarawak governor Taib Mahmud are contained in a report, obtained by Fairfax Media, by an anti-corruption organisation in Switzerland concerned with logging of rainforests in Borneo and displacement of its indigenous people.

In its report, ""The Adelaide Hilton Case – how a Malaysian politician's family laundered $30 million in South Australia"", the Bruno Manser Fund (a Swiss non-government organisation) exposes the corporate connections behind Taib's company Sitehost, which owns Adelaide's $50 million Hilton Hotel.

Major hotels chains like Hilton normally manage and lend their name to properties that are owned by other parties.

Taib Mahmud was a Colombo Plan graduate of University of Adelaide and a substantial benefactor to his old alma mater. He was given an honorary doctorate and had a part of the campus named after him. The University has refused to say how much money it has received from Taib despite although a spokesman said not donations were received in the last eight years. Malaysian investigation

The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) announcing in June 2011 that the billionaire politician was under investigation for corruption.

Under Taib's governorship, nearly 90 per cent of Sarawak's native rainforests have been logged. Despite his modest income as a politician, the family of Taib Mahmud has interests in more than 400 companies in 25 countries.

The report questions how the Taib family could afford to finance the purchase of this major hotel and also a key loan in the deal which together totalled some $30 million in the early 1990s.

Taib's daughter and son-in-law became shareholders of an Australian company, Sitehost, after the family bought shares worth $9.5 million in 1993.

The report says that when Sitehost acquired the Hilton hotel the following year, it took an unsecured loan of $20.75 million ""from a non-bank lender whose identity remained undisclosed for over ten years"". Queensland move

Sitehost revealed in 2007 that the lender was Victorian company Golborne Pty Ltd. The report tracks how that loan was then transferred to another company, Fordland, located in Queensland.

The last available financial accounts for Sitehost are from 2011 and show its main liability was a loan of $18.5 million to Fordland.

The accounts describe a company with 361 employees, revenue of $1.3 million and assets of $52 million (primarily the Hilton).

According to the report, there is strong circumstantial evidence, including a shadow structure on the Isle of Man, that Golborne Australia and Fordland Australia represented the same beneficial owners: the Taib family. Late accounts

Official records are lacking. As a large proprietary company, Sitehost is required to file annual financial statements with The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC).

Its latest annual accounts however were filed in 2013 for the 2011 financial year. There were no accounts filed from the 1998 to 2006. Ernst & Young are the auditors and National Australia the banker.

ASIC declined to say whether it had taken or intended to take any action in regards of the breaches.

""We can't comment on the specifics of your query and any allegations about money laundering should be directed to AUSTRAC as it is Australia's anti-money laundering regulator,"" said a spokesman

""ASIC is one of a number of agencies, including AUSTRAC, that forms the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce. This taskforce was set up to address the threat that serious financial crime poses to the integrity of Australia's financial and regulatory systems.""

According to its most recent filings, Sitehost's directors are Jamilah Taib (Taib Mahmud's daughter), her Canadian husband Sean Murray – who lives in the second most expensive private residence in Ottowa - and two Australian lawyers, Gary Patrick Doherty and John Antoine Kiosoglous.

Contacted by Fairfax Media, Gary Doherty said he did not know the source of the funds behind Golborne or Fordland. 'Conceal', but no subterfuge

Doherty is a partner at the Sydney law firm Low Doherty & Stratford and a director of property development companies, one of which bears the name ""Conceal Pty Ltd"".

Doherty said there was ""no subterfuge"" in the name Conceal.

""When you used to buy shelf companies they were always running out of names. The name was just a word that was there,"" he said.

The other local director of Sitehost, John Kiosoglous, was unavailable for comment. Questions were put to him via a third party.

Doherty said he was aware of the money laundering allegations but had no involvement in money laundering. Nor did he know the source of the funds from Golborne or Fordland.

There is no allegation that either director has been involved in money laundering. Swapping Guernsey

Besides the Taib family, with a 95 per cent holding, the other shareholder in Sitehost is a Guernsey company, not a British Virgin Islands company as disclosed to ASIC.

""By indicating that Astar (this other shareholder with five per cent) is a Guernsey rather than a BVI company, Sitehost's official shareholder information is clearly misleading and likely in breach of ASIC regulations. This might be interpreted as an attempt to conceal the real ownership of Sitehost,"" says the report.

Bruno Manser is calling on Australian authorities to investigate the Taib family interests, as the fund has already done in Canada and the UK. A representative Lukas Straumann has scheduled a press conference for 9.30am Wednesday at the Adelaide Hilton.

On Tuesday afternoon, South Australian MP Mark Parnell read out a motion in parliament expressing concern at the destruction of Malaysian rainforests and the connections between the Taib family, University of Adelaide and the Adelaide Hilton.

A167,"The founders of this nation recognized Islam as one of the world’s great faiths. Incredibly and disgracefully, much of today’s Republican Party disagrees. 

Thomas Jefferson, whose well-worn copy of the Quran is in the Library of Congress, fought to ensure that the American concept of religious freedom encompassed Islam. John Adams wrote that Muhammad was a “sober inquirer after truth.” Benjamin Franklin asserted that even a Muslim missionary sent by “the Mufti of Constantinople” would find there was “a pulpit at his service” in this country. 

Indeed, the Constitution states that “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” Some of the GOP candidates for president, however, simply do not care. 

Ben Carson said Sunday that he believes Islam to be inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore he could not support a Muslim candidate for president. “I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,” he told NBC’s Chuck Todd. “I absolutely would not agree with that.” 

A campaign spokesman, seeking to clarify Carson’s remarks, effectively doubled down by claiming there is a “huge gulf between the faith and practice of the Muslim faith and our Constitution and American values.” 

Carson is dead wrong, but at least he seems sincere about it. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he could only support a Muslim candidate “who will respect the Judeo-Christian heritage of America.” Sen. Rand Paul said a president’s faith should be irrelevant, but he understood many people felt otherwise because “we were attacked by people who were all Muslim.” And front-runner Donald Trump, when asked about the possibility of a Muslim president, wisecracked, “Some people have said it already happened” – a reference to oft-repeated lies about President Obama’s faith. 

I was ready to offer rare praise for Sen. Ted Cruz, who rejected Carson’s outrageous view by pointing to the Constitution’s prohibition against religious tests. But then Cruz went on to say the United States should accept Christian refugees from the Syrian civil war but not Muslims, who might, after all, be terrorists. 

There is an ugly undercurrent of anti-Muslim bigotry in this country, and the Republican Party panders to it in a way that the Democratic Party does not. 

This rancid sentiment was on display at Trump’s town hall meeting in New Hampshire last week, at which a questioner began by stating a premise: “We have a problem in this country, it’s called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know he’s not even an American.” 

The man went on to say that these problematic Muslims “have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That’s my question, when can we get rid of them?” 

Trump should have showed some backbone and told the man his worldview was based on paranoid fantasy. Instead, he made vague noises of agreement, or at least non-disagreement – “A lot of people are saying that. … We’re going to be looking at that and plenty of other things” – which kicked off a round of criticism from his campaign rivals. 

But where were these high-minded, all-embracing Republicans when Trump and others, with no factual support, were casting doubt on Obama’s religion and birthplace? Leaving Obama aside, since he’s in a position to defend himself, where were the wise GOP elders when their party became a refuge for extremists spouting the worst kind of anti-Muslim rhetoric? 

After the  9/11 attacks, George W. Bush did an admirable and important thing: He made clear that blame for the atrocity should not be ascribed to Islam itself but rather to a small group of radical fundamentalists. 

Going forward, however, his administration was neither specific enough nor consistent enough about culpability for the terrorist strike. Warmongers found it politically useful to suggest involvement by Iraq, which had nothing to do with the attacks. Meanwhile, officials downplayed the fact that most of the attackers came from Saudi Arabia, considered a valuable ally. 

This fuzziness, I believe, helped give some Americans the impression that the United States was at war not with small and vicious bands of jihadists but with Muslims more broadly. Democrats almost invariably pushed back against this dangerous misimpression. Republicans far too often did not. 

On the campaign trail, GOP candidates are touting their own Christian faith in what can only be described as a literal attempt to be holier than thou. They should reread the Constitution, which says “no religious test” – not “only the religious test that I can pass.”

A168,"Otago 61 
Southland 7 

Skipper Jamie Mackintosh was the hero for Southland five years ago when his side and Otago met in a Ranfurly Shield classic in Invercargill. 

The big prop scored the winning try that day to retain the Log o' Wood but he was the villain tonight for his beloved Southland, sent from the field midway through the first half in the southern derby. 

Otago took  full advantage of the mismatch, scoring eight tries in the massive 61-7 victory. 

Mackintosh's absence - for a stray elbow off the ball - was a huge blow for the visiting side at Forsyth Barr Stadium and they were under pressure as soon as he departed. 

Otago scored a driving try off a lineout from 15m out virtually as soon as Mackintosh was dismissed. 

The home side rattled on 39 points in the first half and kept the pressure on in the second  spell. 

Even if Mackintosh had stayed on the field, it would have still been the same result. 

By the end, Otago were almost toying with  Southland, who had one of those days they would quickly want to forget. 

Otago were lively in both the backs and forwards, ran some nice angles and found it easier as the game went on to get over the advantage line. 

The blue and golds have been on the improve in recent weeks and it showed some real spark at times, moving the ball all round the paddock to tire out the southern neighbours. 

Hooker and skipper Liam Coltman had been out for a couple of weeks with damaged ribs but came back with a bang, hitting rucks and brushing off would-be tacklers in a first-half try. 

Peter Breen helped himself to 24 points for Otago in the victory, which pushed them into the top four of the ITM Cup Championship. 

Otago 61 (M. Collins, L. Coltman, J. Lentjes, T. Walden, P. Breen, J. Renton, J. Spence, M. Faddes tries; Breen 6 cons, 2 pens, dg) 
Southland 7 (W. Halaholo try, L. Sopoaga con). 
Halftime: 39-7.

A169,"More than eight out of 10 fathers would like to spend time being the primary carer of their baby. More than eight out of 10 fathers would like to spend time being the primary carer of their baby but only 2 per cent have actually done so, as men struggle to reconcile their role as family breadwinner with their desire to be hands-on dads.

Monash University social work lecturer Samone McCurdy surveyed 950 fathers and 14 couples for her doctoral thesis to establish what prevents men from becoming primary carers and what would enable them to do so.

In findings that will be published next month, most men said they would like to take parental leave to look after their child for three months or more, so they can be an involved father and also so their partner can return to the workforce.

Ms McCurdy said the concept of fatherhood had changed. ""Being a father is more than just earning money. They're expected to have relationships with their children directly, and not just through their wives.""

Women's desire to continue their careers also influences men's desire to be the primary carer. ""[Women] are more educated, they have careers, they're having babies later in life. They've built up a lot of social capital so there is a lot more at risk if they pull out of the workforce,"" Ms McCurdy said.

Women felt a lot more confident returning to work once their baby was six months old, if they knew the father was taking over as primary carer. Most fathers said they would quit their job to look after their baby if the alternative was placing them in formal childcare.

But while 85 per cent of men said they would like to spend at least three months as primary carers, they said their traditional status as the primary breadwinner inhibits their ability to do this. Just two per cent have actually taken leave to be the primary carer. Only one in ten fathers said they would act as primary carer if they were paid the federal minimum wage, which is what is provided under the Government's current paid parental leave scheme.

More than half of fathers said parental leave would have to be paid at replacement wage rates if they were to look after their child when the mother went back to work.

If they were paid a replacement wage, fathers said the ideal length of parental leave would be nine to 12 months. If they were paid the minimum wage, they would take just six weeks or less off work.

The acting chief executive of the Federal Workplace Gender Equality Agency, Louise McSorley​, said men needed more encouragement to take longer periods of parental leave. ""Once they get over the financial barriers, they face systemic structural barriers that shut them out of being primary carers for their kids,"" she said.

Ms McCurdy said there wouldn't be true gender equality until society and employers perceived fathers to have the same caring responsibilities as mothers and expected all workers to take a period of leave to be the primary carer of their child.

""The workplace has a critical role in deciding who stays at home and who goes to work, and for how long,"" she said. ""If we really want gender equality to occur, we have to address that pipeline of care.""

Workplace culture is the other impediment to men acting as primary carers. Just 16 per cent of fathers believe they are as accepted as carers as mothers are in the workplace. One man complained that when he returned to work from paternity leave, ""it was as if I had just gone on holidays"".

Ms McCurdy found that organisations made very few provisions for fathers to be primary carers. Fathers said their direct managers' attitude to parental care determined what leave they took, what flexible working arrangements they might be able to secure, and how it affected their career.

Men feared that taking time off to be a primary carer could affect their prospects of a pay rise or promotion, as they were seen to be taking the ""daddy track"" and not serious about their career. Seeking part-time work was akin to signalling they were less committed to their job, while they couldn't even contemplate job-sharing.

DAD AND PARTNER PAY

The taxpayer-funded dad and partner pay scheme has cemented employers' acceptance that fathers will take two weeks off work after the birth of their child.

Introduced in January 2013, the scheme provides most working fathers or partners with two weeks' leave paid at the minimum wage.

An independent evaluation of the scheme found DAPP had made fathers more resolute in insisting on their right to take parental leave around a birth, and had made workplaces more accepting of fathers taking that leave.

""Overall it appears that DAPP has cemented a soft norm of fathers taking two weeks' leave around the time of a birth,"" the report said.

However, it did not boost the proportion of fathers or partners who took leave when their baby was born. Only 36 per cent of those eligible, or more than 100,000 people, received the payment in its first year of operation.

Men were more likely to take DAPP if they worked casually or were self-employed, worked in the public sector, knew other men who had taken parental leave, were older fathers or did not hold traditional gender role attitudes.

DAPP did slightly increase the time new dads spent away from work in the first two months of their child's life, by one day to eleven days. It also saw fathers use DAPP instead of other paid leave, so they could retain that to use at a later date. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

A171,"Ron “Boss” Everline keeps one major rule when he’s training his clients: no talking. Usually that’s an easy proposition when he’s keeping them busy with with reps on the bench press coupled with supersets of pushups and situps or snatching the air from their lungs with high intensity intervals . 
 
But it’s tough to stop the chatter when your client is Kevin Hart. 
 
“Now Kevin is difficult, he’s always clowning around which is great for me,” said Everline, who’s been called “Boss” since his childhood after Dukes of Hazzar character Boss Hog. 
 
  
Boss admits he rarely has been able to silence Hart during a workout unless the comedian is distracted by other work. But since Everline likes to train alongside his clients – which have included celebrities like Ne-Yo, Christian Milian and Trey Songz – he appreciates Hart’s infectious energy.  It also makes it that much easier to trash talk. Since Everline both travels and trains with Hart, they’ve made a habit of turning everything into a competition. 
 
Everline says that much of Hart’s routine focuses on core strength , not just building six-pack abs. But, for example, they might have a goal to hit 1000 pushups each day. The last person to complete the task will be punished, whether that means they’ll pay for dinner, the next round of gas or paying a $1,00 fine. 
 
  
“It’s all about accountability,” Boss said. “It’s about making it fun.” 
 
When the duo started, Hart could push a 135-pound bench press. Now Everline said the “Get Hard” star can max out around 245 pounds. Hart’s been known for his boundless energy. Everline says that training kicks up a notch during movie 
 
Everline, who had NFL aspirations, played linebacker at Northwest Missouri. Before starting his personal training business. His first celebrity client was R&B singer Ne-Yo, who he worked with for three years before hooking up with Hart. Everline said he never actually sought out working with celebrities. Performance training was just a part of his lifestyle, a lifestyle he thought he could make a living sharing. 
 
Now if you follow Kevin Hart’s Instagram, you’ll see plenty of workout images and videos, some of which aso feature Boss. 
 
  
He’s joined Hart for multiple spontaneous 5K runs all over the country, including Chicago, San Francisco, Portland and Brooklyn, all as a means to help inspire people to get active and make health a priority.

A172,"NIAMEY Niger's former head of parliament and exiled opposition figure Hama Amadou, who is being sought in connection with an investigation into child-trafficking, vowed on Monday to return home to stand in a presidential election next year. 

Some 30 members of the country's political and social elite, including Hama's wife, have been charged with acquiring around 30 new-born babies from ""baby factories"" in neighbouring Nigeria. 

Hama, once a close ally of President Mahamadou Issoufou but now considered one of his chief rivals in the February polls, fled to France last year before he could be questioned by investigators. 

He has maintained that the case is politically motivated, and on Sunday he was nominated as his MODEN party's candidate for the presidency. 

""I will be in Niger. I will participate in the elections, even if I am in prison. I'll be there soon,"" Hama said in an interview with Niger's Bonferey television channel. 
 
Hama finished third in the last election in 2011 and subsequently supported Issoufou in a run-off, helping seal his victory. 

However, the two men fell out in 2013 over Issoufou's formation of a government of national unity, a decision Hama accused him of taking unilaterally. 
 
""I will be with the opposition and if I finish third once again, I will support the opposition candidate in the second round, whoever that is,"" Hama said. 

In a recent interview with French magazine Paris Match, Interior Minister Hassoumi Massaoudou said Hama would be arrested if he returned to Niger.

A173,"LAWTON, MI - Lawton football coach Tony Karsen said his team needed some adversity.  

Through four games, the Blue Devils were hardly tested, winning each contest by at least 20 points and rolling to a 4-0 record.  

On Friday, Lawton got their first true test of the season, and made just enough plays to pass, hanging on for a 30-27 win over Gobles in the MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette Game of the Week.  

After roaring out to a 23-0 lead late in the second quarter, the Blue Devils (5-0, 2-0 SAC-Central) gave up 27-straight points to the Tigers (3-2, 1-2 SAC-Central) and found themselves down 27-23 with 6:25 left in the fourth. A blocked punt helped spur the offense, which drove 59 yards, including a fourth and sixth conversion from their own 45, to retake the lead 30-27. Needing a final defensive stand, the Blue Devils forced an incomplete pass on fourth and eight from their own 49 to preserve the win.  

“We needed to get socked in the mouth at least once at some point in this season and see how we respond to that hit,” Karsen said. “We knew it was going to be a battle for four quarters, and our boys picked it up when it mattered.” 

The win keeps the Blue Devils in the race for the Southwestern Athletic Conference title. It also means that next week’s game against Schoolcraft (5-0) will be for first place in the division and will lock up a playoff berth for the winner.  

The Blue Devils opened up the scoring early on Gobles. On the second play from scrimmage, quarterback Derek Leighton faked a handoff up the middle and took the ball to the outside. He found the edge and got some blocking from wide receiver Jarod Wimes for a 73-yard touchdown run. Leighton said they had been saving that play for the right occasion.  

“That might have been the first designed run I’ve had all season,” Leighton said. “I don’t experience open grass like that. Jarod Wimes had a great block. The offensive line did their job. It was a great fake up the middle.” 

On Gobles first drive, the Tigers moved the ball well, going 66 yards in seven plays to get the ball down to the Lawton 14, but a fumble on the quarterback exchange gave the ball back to the Blue Devils. Gobles forced a punt, but the Gobles returner couldn’t hold onto the ball and Lawton’s Dakota Raterink recovered at the Gobles 21. Gobles fumbled the ball four times in the first half, with Lawton recovering three. Tigers’ coach Jim Wiseley said giving the ball away really cost his team.   

“In big games, you can’t do that. A couple of (the turnovers) were mental mistakes and two of them were effort, and you hate to blame effort, but the kids were going for extra yards and put the ball on the ground,” Wiseley said.  

Following the fumble recovery, Lawton ran four straight times capped by a three-yard touchdown plunge by Raterink. Raterink, a senior, was all over the field for the Blue Devils on Friday, recovering two fumbles, rushing the ball 12 times for 52 yards and a touchdown, catching two passes for 96 yards and blocking a punt.  

After trading possessions, Gobles once again gave the football away, with Lawton recovering another fumble at the Tigers’ 39. Once again, the Blue Devils were able to put points on the board, with Wimes knocking home a 29-yard field goal.  

After moving the ball 64 yards on their next drive, Gobles elected to go for it on fourth down from the Lawton 16, but were stuffed short. Lawton took advantage of the change of possession. On third down, Leighton found Raterink down the sideline for a 69 yard gain. Two plays later, Leighton hit Wimes in the flat for a 13-yard touchdown catch as the Blue Devils extended their lead to 23-0. Wimes finished with four receptions for 29 yards and ran the ball twice for eight yards.  

With time ticking away before the end of the half, Gobles found some hope. Putting together a ten-play drive, the Tigers were able to pick up big chunks of yardage on the ground. The drive was capped by a Travis Chandler two-yard touchdown run with eight seconds left in the second quarter. Wiseley said that was a big swing for them right before the break.  

“Just scoring points at that point was big, we knew we had a large deficit,” Wiseley said. “We knew once we got into halftime and made the adjustments we needed to make we would be all right.” 

In the second half, the Tigers took just 1:23 to march the ball down the field and cut the deficit to 23-14. Tyler Fuhrman took the ball straight up the middle for 53 yards for the score.   

On its first drive of the second half, Lawton stalled after picking up one first down and was forced to punt. Again, the Gobles offense found rhythm and this time it was Mason Lawson’s turn to make a big play. The senior fullback broke a 50-yard touchdown run. The point after was blocked, but Gobles was down three and had momentum on its side.  

The Tigers forced a three-and-out on Lawton’s next offensive possession. Not showing any signs of slowing down, the Tigers picked up 52 yards in seven plays and took their first lead of the game with 1:05 left in the third quarter on Chandler’s second score of the night. Chandler, a sophomore, finished with 131 yards on 24 carries and two touchdowns.  

“Our kids were shellshocked for a bit, but you settle in, you stay composed and you trust your schemes and you trust each other,” Karsen said of the mood on the sideline. “Gobles is physical, they get off the ball well, they’re very disciplined with their offensive scheme and their defense. We knew it was going to be physical verse physical.” 

Leighton said the Blue Devils were throwing everything they had at the Tigers.  

“It was a difficult time,” Leighton said. “We were doing everything we could, we had every formation and we couldn’t stop them.”  

Another three-and-out by the Lawton offense gave Gobles a chance to extend its lead with 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Despite running 11 plays and holding onto the ball for more than five minutes, the Tigers were forced to punt for the first time in the second half with 6:25 left in the game. Lawton took advantage of the opportunity, blocking the kick and taking over at the Gobles 41.  

“Special teams is instant momentum,” Karsen said. “Our kids made a great play and that gave new life to our offense and we were able to capitalize.” 

The Blue Devils used the passing game to pick up chunks of yardage, including Leighton finding Wimes on fourth down to extend the drive. On the next play, Raterink took a crossing route 27 yards to get down to the Gobles 11. Three plays later, he finished the drive with his second touchdown run of the night. Leighton finished the game 8-for-10 for 125 yards and a touchdown.  

“We really had to pick it up, that was really a test of manhood right there,” Leighton said. “We manned up in that fourth quarter.” 

Gobles got the ball back at its own 20 and were able to get to midfield, but incomplete passes on third and fourth down ended the Tigers hope for a comeback. Karsen said he trusted his defense on that final drive.  

“I’m extremely confident in our defense,” Karsen said. “I’ve been in this position many times over the past ten years and they just step up. It’s a matter of staying composed and doing your assignment and winning the ball game.” 

Wiseley said turnovers marred what was otherwise an impressive performance by his squad.  

“Our kids fought,” Wiseley said. “We scored 20 points, gave up one touchdown the entire second half. Lawton rose up and scored to win it, but I’m proud of our kids.”  

Lawton now turns its attention to Schoolcraft and readies for another big game next week. Karsen said he will enjoy this victory tonight, but tomorrow his attention turns to Schoolcraft.

A174,"Newquay RNLI lifeguards and volunteer lifeboat crews came to the aid of a couple who were cut off by the tide on Thursday afternoon. 
 
Lifeguards at Watergate Bay launched the rescue water craft (RWC) after the couple, who are staying in Watergate Bay, became cut off by the incoming tide while walking along a stretch of beach between Watergate Bay and Whipsiderry. 
 
They put a call into the local water sport centre Extreme Academy who alerted RNLI lifeguards Georges Tickner and Warren Llewllyn, who launched the RWC at 1pm, with both Newquay inshore lifeboats also called in to assist. 
 
The lifeguards were able to reach the couple, who were metres from the incoming water, within minutes. 
 
Georges Tickner, RNLI lifeguard at Watergate Bay, said: “We were able to reach the couple within five minutes of the call. They were both really relieved and thankful when we arrived. They were cold but unharmed. 
 
""If they hadn’t called for help when they did they could have ended up waist deep in water and it would have been more serious.

A175,"Jeb Bush will call for lighter regulation of the energy sector and for more local control of natural resources when he delivers his energy plan Tuesday at a natural gas company in Western Pennsylvania. 
 
The Republican presidential candidate will also praise the advances of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking, a position that puts him in line with many in his party but squarely opposed to environmental activists. And he'll call for lifting restrictions on the export of crude oil and promote exporting natural gas to non-Free Trade Agreement countries such as Japan, China and the European Union. 

Bush regularly touts the innovation of fracking on the campaign trail, describing it as part of an ""energy revolution"" that could significantly boost growth. His speech will takes place at Rice Energy, Inc., in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, an oil and gas company that gets some of its gas through fracking, and, according to the campaign, would benefit from Bush's policies. 

The company and its subsidiaries have been subject to 121 violations with the state Department of Environmental Protection and amassed more than half a million dollars in fines since 2010, according to the Huffington Post. 

Bush, the former governor of Florida, argues that companies like Rice face too many regulations, something he argues holds back energy growth. One of the biggest barriers by the federal government in his eyes is the Keystone XL pipeline, which would complete a 3,800-mile pipeline network that runs from Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. 

Opponents of the project cite environmental concerns and worries about the impact on tribal communities near the pipeline, but proponents, like Bush, say that the finished project would create thousands of jobs and contribute to economic output. 

His campaign is publishing a preview of the speech on Medium Tuesday that hits President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton -- both of whom oppose the pipeline -- for holding up the project. 

""President Obama and Hillary Clinton have baldly politicized the government permitting process by opposing the Keystone XL pipeline,"" the post will read. ""After seven years and an unprecedented level of environmental review, there is now no credible reason for the President to stand in the way of this privately funded project."" 

It's all part of what Bush considers federal overreach that limits state and tribal use of natural resources. Bush frequently criticizes Obama's use of executive orders to create new rules, like standards for carbon plants and limits on greenhouse gas emissions. 

He also disagrees with the overwriting of state and tribal standards for hydraulic fracking and pledges to stop some of Obama's regulations ""in their tracks."" 

The Medium post, however, makes no mention of the Obama administration giving approval to Shell earlier this year to drill in the Arctic waters off the coast of Alaska, a decision that angered environmental activists in Obama's base. 

Instead, the post focuses on Clinton, who made her first major break with the President while on the campaign trail by disagreeing with Obama's decision to allow Arctic drilling.

A176,"A GARDENER endured a closer encounter with a pair of shears than he might have liked when a barber chopped his iconic red mane for the first time in 30 years. 
 
It was a big moment when barber Martin Coleman lopped off Gordon Baillie's ginger plait, which has become an integral part of the head gardener's persona. 
 
But for Gordon, who works at Arley Hall, it was the right thing to do as he was joining in Macmillan Cancer Support's Brave the Shave appeal. 
 
“I’ve not had my hair cut since 1985,” he said. 
 
“Maybe it is part of my character, but I usually wear a hat and have it tied back so I don’t think it will change my profile too much.” 
 
Gordon, who turned 50 this month, wanted to support Macmillan because he lost his father and brother-in-law to cancer. 
 
One of his friends is also suffering from terminal throat cancer so he felt the need to show his support. 
 
It was a big decision for him, but as his locks were being shaved it proved an emotional experience for wife Bridgette who has plaited his hair every day for 23 years. 
 
“It has been a ritual of ours every day and I am going to miss it even though I always complained about having to do it,” she said. 
 
“It did have its problems. 
 
""He never used to dry it properly so the pillows used to get wet, but it was part of Gordon.” 
 
The ponytail has not been lost, however. It was cut off with a pair of shears by Gordon’s colleague James Youd and Bridgette has kept it for posterity. 
 
Visitors to Arley Hall have been leaving donations at the gift shop and Gordon’s colleagues have also generously helped him raise more than £700 so far.

A178,"Ray: I have been listening to Tim May talk about the Buckeyes being six-time national champions
ever since they defeated Oregon. In your 2015 season preview, the six national championships are
mentioned again. What gives? 
 
Anyone not just getting to town knows that the Bucks have eight national championship trophies!
Just because all of them were not “consensus” titles, they were titles nonetheless! 
 
What’s Tim’s problem? Maybe he is related to Mark May? 
 
 — Pat Stuhldreher, Columbus  
 
 Pat: Here’s what I tell people: You celebrate however many Ohio State titles you like. We
recognize six, though “consensus” has nothing to do with it. In fact, two of OSU’s titles (1954 and
’57) are shared and thus are not consensus at all. Our standard for pre-BCS championships are those
awarded by a wire service (AP writers or UPI coaches), which excludes 1961 and ’70 — and,
interestingly, a lot of other years.  
 
Mr. Stein: I have to take exception to the ranking of “two leaves” for “Fun quotient” in the
Bottom Line (Tuesday). My wife and I had a great time. You didn’t think it was loud? You must have
been sitting indoors. 
 
I have been at a white-out at Penn State, an OSU-Michigan game in the Big House, and the ’Shoe
for most of the largest crowds ever. My section of Lane Stadium was just as loud, and Hokies fans
boisterously cheered their team until the game got out of hand and they had no real quarterback who
could stage any sort of comeback. 
 
All the fans I met (I sat in a Hokies section, and tailgated in a reserved section of the
parking lot) were friendly and courteous throughout. 
 
I am a Buckeye season-ticket holder and online Dispatch subscriber living in northern Virginia, and I can say that Virginia Tech has a
beautiful campus and a fervent fan base. 
 
 — Bob Klocek  
 
 Fairfax Station, Va.  
 
 Bob: I don’t disagree about the campus scenery, but I sure didn’t get a sense of fever-pitch
rowdiness from my press-box seat. The place was no mausoleum, especially in the second quarter, but
it was a far cry from Madison or State College. It reminded me of OSU’s 1998 game against West
Virginia in Morgantown, where the home fans expected their team to get thumped, and then were not
surprised.  
 
Editor: I hope the Buckeyes players who were suspended for the first game are proud of
themselves — nothing like a selfish act to put your teammates in a bind right from the start. I
realize a championship team has to have depth, but that doesn’t give players with scholarships the
OK to do as they please, knowing that they have someone to pick up their slack. 
 
These young men are role models to kids who idolize them. So what do they take away from this?
Are they learning that if they’re an important player, they can do what they please and let someone
else cover for their mistakes? 
 
 — Terry Culp, Canal Winchester  
 
 Terry: Well, I suspect they’ve learned that they can’t do as they please, because they were
denied perhaps the one thing they cherish the most — playing time. That’s not nothing.  
 
Editor: Nooooo!!! I watched the Wisconsin-Alabama game last Saturday night. Why was the hulking
visage of mega-chump Mark May appearing on my screen? 
 
I thought I had read, maybe back in January, that he had rightfully been dumped into the ash can
of video history. 
 
 — Richard Erb  
 
 Clear Brook, Va.  
 
 Richard: May was bounced from ESPN’s College Football Final about the same time Lou Holtz
departed, but the network gave him another, less visible show to continue his shtick of banging on
Ohio State.  
 
Editor: I am a graduate of Virginia Tech who was invited to the OSU-VT game on Monday by an OSU
fan. I unfortunately sat in the OSU section. 
 
I have never experienced arrogant, taunting and offensive behavior like I saw Monday. Obviously,
OSU has the better talent. While many OSU fans were enthusiastic and avid supporters of their team,
many others were cussing, booing, laughing at injured players, taking pictures and mocking VT fans
leaving. Many were loud and abusive. 
 
We gladly gave up our seats during the first half but saw the same behavior in other sections of
the stadium. 
 
You may have one of the best college football teams in history, but you also have some of the
most unsportsmanlike fans I have ever seen. I hope the fan behavior improves as the season
progresses. 
 
 — Thomas Sherrod  
 
 Statesville, N.C.  
 
 Thomas: Well, there’s always hope, even if for a few people it resides in a different area code
from reality.  
 
Ray: As the NFL kicks off its season, it is absurd that the league will celebrate its 50th Super
Bowl at the end of the year. Did the league not have a championship game during its first 50
seasons? Well, of course they did. 
 
It was only called the NFL Championship, which is exactly what the Super Bowl represents. As a
matter of fact, the Cleveland Browns have won four championships. Yet they never receive the proper
credit because they all occurred prior to the championship game being called the Super Bowl. 
 
During the Browns’ first decade in the league, the team played in the championship game seven
times, winning three. Yet not one football talking head mentions these historical feats, only that
the Browns are one of four teams that have never played in a Super Bowl. Granted, those
championships were a long, long time ago, but I am old enough to remember the last one, in
1964. 
 
 — Steven H. Spring, South Charleston  
 
 Steven: I remember that last title, too. And I also remember about that time watching Jonny
Quest and drinking Choc-Ola out of a can. In other words, a lot has changed since Gary Collins was
catching passes from Frank Ryan. The truth of the matter is the Super Bowl is the biggest sporting
event in the country, and the Browns have never been in it.  
 
Sports editor: As a transplanted Pittsburgher living now in central Ohio, I have been amazed at
the large number of Pittsburgh fans here, especially on the East Side. During football season, you
would think on Sunday that you were in a Pittsburgh suburb with all the people wearing their
Steelers gear. 
 
But The Dispatch ignores this whole section of readers, instead concentrating on the Bengals
and Browns every day during the season. I can say it is rare that I see anyone wearing Browns gear
in Columbus! 
 
Please give the Steelers faithful in Columbus some coverage during the season! 
 
 — Tom Thompson, Pickerington  
 
 Tom: Note to self: Stay away from the East Side, especially on Sundays.

A179,"Oh, goody. Just when you thought you never had to hear from the Duggars again, TLC has ordered several specials that will focus on the two oldest daughters, Jill and Jessa, according to The Hollywood Reporter . The girls were two of the victims whom older brother Josh molested. TLC canceled 19 Kids & Counting , the Duggar clan's original reality show, earlier this year after Josh Duggar admitted to molesting several girls in his youth. The specials will follow Jill and her new family -- husband Derick Dillard and son Israel, who was born in April -- as they move to El Salvador to do mission work; and Jessa Seewald, who is expecting her first child with husband Ben later this year. Duggar discord: Has Jessa turned on Josh? This news might explain why Jessa had distanced herself from her brother with Facebook posts that appeared to criticize him.

McDonald's fans have begged the chain for years to serve its breakfast menu past 10:30 a.m. 

McDonald's will finally answer their prayers next month with the rollout of an all-day breakfast menu.

But there's a huge catch.

The all-day menu will be limited to only a couple breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, and sides.

McDonald's restaurants will serve either McMuffin sandwiches or biscuit sandwiches — not both — depending on local preferences, according to the company.

The restaurants serving McMuffin sandwiches will only serve three kinds: The egg McMuffin, the sausage McMuffin with egg, and the sausage McMuffin.

Those serving biscuit sandwiches will also have three options: The bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, the sausage biscuit with egg, and the sausage biscuit.

Pancakes, sausage burritos, yogurt and oatmeal will also be on the menu.

McGriddles and bagels won't be available. Hash browns may be available at some restaurants.

McDonald's is limiting the menu to prevent kitchens from getting overwhelmed by cooking breakfast and burgers at the same time.

The chain has previously said it doesn't serve 24-hour breakfast because its grills aren't big enough to handle breakfast and lunch items.

""It comes down to the sheer size of kitchen grills,"" the company said on its website. ""They simply don't have the room for all of our menu options at one time — especially considering we use our grill to prepare many items on our breakfast menu.""

Now the brand have brought their range of vintage-inspired turntables to the UK, led by the Crosley Nomad, one of the most luxurious vintage style turntables they have created. The Nomad has three different speeds, built-in speakers, an auxiliary input, headphone jack, and RCA outputs. And the Nomad’s classic briefcase style design, reminiscent of 1950s and 1960s record players, lets you take your music out in style.       But the Nomad is not all vintage. It’s also bang up to date with the ability to transfer your vinyl into digital files through the USB record enabled plug in, and the software that is comes complimentary with every turntable, so wherever you want to take your vinyl, the Nomad can take you there. For more details on Crosley please visit www.crosleyradio.com or www.facebook.com/CrosleyRadio. Follow on Twitter and Instagram as @Crosleyradio.   COMPETITION: To celebrate the Crosley Nomad UK launch, we’re giving away one of these fantastic turntables to a lucky reader (value £209.99)!

A183,"Yogi Berra was a 15-time All Star and 10-time World Series champion, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1972 
Washington (AFP) - Iconic New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra, an athlete as beloved for his folksy sayings as for his legendary baseball career, has died, the Yogi Berra Museum said early Wednesday. He was 90. 
 
The Hall of Famer and three-time Most Valuable Player died of ""natural causes"" late Tuesday, the museum said in a statement. 
 
""Yogi conducted his life with unwavering integrity, humility and a contagious good humor that elevated him from baseball legend to beloved national icon,"" the museum said. 
 
Berra, a 15-time All Star and 10-time World Series champion, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1972. 
 
But the baseball great was equally well-known for humorous quips and malapropisms such as ""It's deja vu all over again."" 
 
Others include such one-liners as ""It ain't over till it's over"" and ""When you come to a fork in the road, take it."" 
 
Major League Baseball columnist Marty Noble said on the league's online news page that ""a loss that unquestionably transcends the game has sent all of baseball into deep mourning."" 
 
Berra's museum announced his death ""with a profound sense of loss and heartfelt sorrow."" 
 
His family added that ""while we mourn the loss of our father, grandfather and great-grandfather, we know he is at peace with Mom.""

A184,"Bernie’s Agenda: ’Democratic-Capitalism,’ Not Old World ‘Socialism’ Bernie Sanders, by any classic measure, is a lousy socialist who should jettison this inflammatory, injurious misnomer. Does embracing “socialism” — an open-ended, domestic land mine — not cloud his brilliant career, his surging national esteem and jaw-dropping campaign success? If winning the nomination is the prize, then why deliver a flaming torch to every scornful interviewer, partisan Republican, or Hillary defender so they can light up the night sky with painful distortions? Does Sanders talk up nationalizing major industries? Top-down, centralized economic control? Widespread price controls, suspicion of private property, even sanctified Five Year Plans? That’s what vast numbers of voters, let alone political scientists, think of as “socialism.” For this pragmatic progressive, time the Sanders’ team reconsiders a self-induced obstacle between him and a stunning primary upset that would rock our political foundations. Plus, igniting my model for a progressive era that must last a generation or more to equal the first Progressive Era.  Curiously, when activist Burlington mayor, Sanders didn’t push “socializing” city utilities, though he achieved “community trust housing” and fought intrusive cable price hikes and bad lakefront development. Not exactly splashy “democratic socialism.” I posit more traction if he embraced his first allegiance, the Liberty Union Party. Let’s face it: anything that reeks of “socialism” communes on these shores of denial and ignorance with communism, inviting knee-jerk tar and feathering by jerks. And most significantly, without upsides that expand popularity. How many socialist voters — Scandinavian or otherwise, per Bernie’s praise — will decide our dozen key battleground states? What overt “socialist” candidate has wowed Democratic voters since noble figures, Eugene Debs and Norman Thomas, made news long, long ago? Nationally, in ’12, under 5000 voted “socialist.” Socialism, the Shrinking US Cult Frankly, rightwing extremism sells better in polling: look how well the Trumpster does with proto-fascist rants. Would Trumpery not wither if he depicted his immigration wall folly as a perpetual, socialist-monopoly boondoggle, marrying private industries and top-down federalism to serve Tea Party fantasies? Is not his entire anti-immigrant package a bizarre way to empower the state to “socialize” primitive values,  keeping the US as white as long as possible? Makes the federalized “socialism” of public schooling or Medicare look tame. I make a point here solely about nomenclature as this is certainly not Sanders’, nor my own, positive view of humane European socialism. I appreciate the senator’s loyalty to this mavericky term that fuels fierceness against the corporate billionaire class, blindly equating socialism with infamy. I get the logic for a breakthrough candidate to redeem a tarnished phrase to widen his appeal, talking up when government works. Good candidates define themselves first and clearly, before foes with millions slice and dice “who he really is.” Yet, why offer up, as if deeply revealing, a negative word that misrepresents Sanders’ own potent agenda? On point, where’s the core socialism behind Sanders’ insistence that bloated billionaires pay their fair share and not dictate government elections? Eisenhower and others did that by refusing to change the top tax of 90%, warning about the military-industrial complex, and enacting campaign funding limits. Does Bernie’s socialism ever condemn the goal of making money — or instead criticize how rigged courts and Congress produce gaping loopholes that make dangerous billionaire concentrations inevitable? There’s nothing socialistic about dressing down the self-absorbed rich who think they should run everything. Jefferson, then progressives a century later, warned fiercely about the evils of ruthless corporatism. Has Sanders ever condemned the sanctity of private property or pushed for Washington to commandeer major industries? Not that I’ve heard. Demanding universal health care, with strictly regulated prices, closes down no corporate health providers—- only humanizes them to act like profitable public utilities? How many corporate giants go bankrupt serving Medicare? What, No President Ideology? What Sanders underestimates is how greatly Yanks hate ideology, especially imported systems from the repellent, tainted Old World. Only the horror of communism outpoints socialism in this hall of shame — and for Republicans a “slam-dunk” cudgel against Democrats, with Obama laughably slammed for “socialism” that pays off slavish minorities. Winning candidates shy away from rigid, systemic abstractions that offend one group without predictable offsets, across history and political parties.  Sure, visions, triumphs and empty pledges work, but not rigid fixations or ideological rectitude. Sanders after all is anything but an ideologue, socialist or otherwise — and less of a “democratic socialist” than a “democratic capitalist.” Like FDR, Sanders’ agenda will redeem, even rationalize tarnished capitalism.  Does he preach the end of capitalism, even so far drastic systemic changes? Does Sanders impugn GDP except when producing too much pollution from fossil fuels, thus HIS top environmental solutions? Does Sanders not still boast of the slice of the job-producing military-industrial complex he escorted to Vermont? Even his challenge to dubious WS bailouts, shielding “too big to fail” banks, keeps Sanders in the capitalistic camp, reinforced by his industry-serving jobs programs, infrastructure projects, and sensible trade notions. No president is electable by assailing the present economic system, awarded nearly religious reverence. Certainly, let’s reinstate Glass-Steagall, but if that’s ardent socialism, I’ll eat my progressive hat.  Frankly, I can’t find one Sanders proposal that smacks of classic socialism. Take free college education: no threat to capitalism, even profit-driven schools; it’s mainly about who pays the tab, not that Washington dictate policy for higher education. Sanders Echoes FDR, not Debs Not only is Sanders not much of a socialist but, like FDR, embraces an agenda that lifts the capital-depleted middle-class and raises wages to boost consumer spending, likely to save today’s worst-case version of crony capitalism from itself. In fact, to find the best examples of bad, recent “corporate” socialism, look no further than Dubya’s corrupt TARP bank bailouts or Obama’s loans that saved General Motors. Years ago in Vermont Sanders got re-elected by calling himself a “democratic-socialist.” Bully for old times. But craven sound bites and catch phrases now dominate the national political stage. I question whether “socialism,” with its historic, negative connotations, is not a hard-to-defend, risky ploy, especially when winning over less informed and unaligned moderates in ley battleground states. Finally, I dread what the vast, overheated, irrational right-wing conspiracy will do with a curse second in smear value to communism. Since Birtherism lasted far, far more than the fifteen minutes of infamy it deserved . . . and if the right can turn the nothing-burger of Benghazi into months of harangue . . . if anti-immigration bigotry tops early GOP polling, just imagine and tremble. On a lighter note, Sanders might take a leaf from Karl Rove: if not “democratic-capitalist,” how about “compassionate, American-born socialism”? Okay, why not “compassionate capitalism?” That phrase, alas, has a major practical downside: skeptical Sanders’ millions are more likely to fall down laughing, in stitches, so long they miss getting to the voting booth.

Good candidates define themselves first and clearly, before foes with millions slice and dice “who he really is.” Yet, why offer up, as if deeply revealing, a negative word that misrepresents Sanders’ own potent agenda? On point, where’s the core socialism behind Sanders’ insistence that bloated billionaires pay their fair share and not dictate government elections? Eisenhower and others did that by refusing to change the top tax of 90%, warning about the military-industrial complex, and enacting campaign funding limits. Does Bernie’s socialism ever condemn the goal of making money — or instead criticize how rigged courts and Congress produce gaping loopholes that make dangerous billionaire concentrations inevitable? There’s nothing socialistic about dressing down the self-absorbed rich who think they should run everything. Jefferson, then progressives a century later, warned fiercely about the evils of ruthless corporatism. Has Sanders ever condemned the sanctity of private property or pushed for Washington to commandeer major industries? Not that I’ve heard. Demanding universal health care, with strictly regulated prices, closes down no corporate health providers—- only humanizes them to act like profitable public utilities? How many corporate giants go bankrupt serving Medicare? What, No President Ideology? What Sanders underestimates is how greatly Yanks hate ideology, especially imported systems from the repellent, tainted Old World. Only the horror of communism outpoints socialism in this hall of shame — and for Republicans a “slam-dunk” cudgel against Democrats, with Obama laughably slammed for “socialism” that pays off slavish minorities. Winning candidates shy away from rigid, systemic abstractions that offend one group without predictable offsets, across history and political parties.  Sure, visions, triumphs and empty pledges work, but not rigid fixations or ideological rectitude. Sanders after all is anything but an ideologue, socialist or otherwise — and less of a “democratic socialist” than a “democratic capitalist.” Like FDR, Sanders’ agenda will redeem, even rationalize tarnished capitalism.  Does he preach the end of capitalism, even so far drastic systemic changes? Does Sanders impugn GDP except when producing too much pollution from fossil fuels, thus HIS top environmental solutions? Does Sanders not still boast of the slice of the job-producing military-industrial complex he escorted to Vermont? Even his challenge to dubious WS bailouts, shielding “too big to fail” banks, keeps Sanders in the capitalistic camp, reinforced by his industry-serving jobs programs, infrastructure projects, and sensible trade notions. No president is electable by assailing the present economic system, awarded nearly religious reverence. Certainly, let’s reinstate Glass-Steagall, but if that’s ardent socialism, I’ll eat my progressive hat.  Frankly, I can’t find one Sanders proposal that smacks of classic socialism. Take free college education: no threat to capitalism, even profit-driven schools; it’s mainly about who pays the tab, not that Washington dictate policy for higher education. Sanders Echoes FDR, not Debs Not only is Sanders not much of a socialist but, like FDR, embraces an agenda that lifts the capital-depleted middle-class and raises wages to boost consumer spending, likely to save today’s worst-case version of crony capitalism from itself. In fact, to find the best examples of bad, recent “corporate” socialism, look no further than Dubya’s corrupt TARP bank bailouts or Obama’s loans that saved General Motors. Years ago in Vermont Sanders got re-elected by calling himself a “democratic-socialist.” Bully for old times. But craven sound bites and catch phrases now dominate the national political stage. I question whether “socialism,” with its historic, negative connotations, is not a hard-to-defend, risky ploy, especially when winning over less informed and unaligned moderates in ley battleground states. Finally, I dread what the vast, overheated, irrational right-wing conspiracy will do with a curse second in smear value to communism. Since Birtherism lasted far, far more than the fifteen minutes of infamy it deserved . . . and if the right can turn the nothing-burger of Benghazi into months of harangue . . . if anti-immigration bigotry tops early GOP polling, just imagine and tremble. On a lighter note, Sanders might take a leaf from Karl Rove: if not “democratic-capitalist,” how about “compassionate, American-born socialism”? Okay, why not “compassionate capitalism?” That phrase, alas, has a major practical downside: skeptical Sanders’ millions are more likely to fall down laughing, in stitches, so long they miss getting to the voting booth.

A184,"Bernie’s Agenda: ’Democratic-Capitalism,’ Not Old World ‘Socialism’ Bernie Sanders, by any classic measure, is a lousy socialist who should jettison this inflammatory, injurious misnomer. Does embracing “socialism” — an open-ended, domestic land mine — not cloud his brilliant career, his surging national esteem and jaw-dropping campaign success? If winning the nomination is the prize, then why deliver a flaming torch to every scornful interviewer, partisan Republican, or Hillary defender so they can light up the night sky with painful distortions? Does Sanders talk up nationalizing major industries? Top-down, centralized economic control? Widespread price controls, suspicion of private property, even sanctified Five Year Plans? That’s what vast numbers of voters, let alone political scientists, think of as “socialism.” For this pragmatic progressive, time the Sanders’ team reconsiders a self-induced obstacle between him and a stunning primary upset that would rock our political foundations. Plus, igniting my model for a progressive era that must last a generation or more to equal the first Progressive Era.  Curiously, when activist Burlington mayor, Sanders didn’t push “socializing” city utilities, though he achieved “community trust housing” and fought intrusive cable price hikes and bad lakefront development. Not exactly splashy “democratic socialism.” I posit more traction if he embraced his first allegiance, the Liberty Union Party. Let’s face it: anything that reeks of “socialism” communes on these shores of denial and ignorance with communism, inviting knee-jerk tar and feathering by jerks. And most significantly, without upsides that expand popularity. How many socialist voters — Scandinavian or otherwise, per Bernie’s praise — will decide our dozen key battleground states? What overt “socialist” candidate has wowed Democratic voters since noble figures, Eugene Debs and Norman Thomas, made news long, long ago? Nationally, in ’12, under 5000 voted “socialist.” Socialism, the Shrinking US Cult Frankly, rightwing extremism sells better in polling: look how well the Trumpster does with proto-fascist rants. Would Trumpery not wither if he depicted his immigration wall folly as a perpetual, socialist-monopoly boondoggle, marrying private industries and top-down federalism to serve Tea Party fantasies? Is not his entire anti-immigrant package a bizarre way to empower the state to “socialize” primitive values,  keeping the US as white as long as possible? Makes the federalized “socialism” of public schooling or Medicare look tame. I make a point here solely about nomenclature as this is certainly not Sanders’, nor my own, positive view of humane European socialism. I appreciate the senator’s loyalty to this mavericky term that fuels fierceness against the corporate billionaire class, blindly equating socialism with infamy.

A188,"Michael Reese and Jay Kinder recently hit two Amazon best-seller lists with the new book, “Top Dollar” 

Frisco, TX – September 3, 2015 – Michael Reese and Jay Kinder recently joined other leading real estate experts from around the world to co-author their new book So You Can Get Top Dollar For Your Home in Minimum Time. CelebrityPress™ - a leading business book publisher-- released the book on June 11, 2015. 
   
On the day of its release, Top Dollar r eached best-seller status in several Amazon categories – reaching #1 in the ‘Real Estate Sales’ category, #8 in the ‘Buying and Selling Homes’ category, and achieving best seller status in the ‘Real Estate’ and ‘Small Business and Entrepreneurship’ categories. Michael Reese contributed a chapter titled ‘The Power in the Right Price,” and Jay Kinder wrote “How To Turn Top Dollar Into Net Profit - The Single Page That Will Determine How Much Equity You Will Walk Away With When You Sell Your Home.” 

More than 10 years ago luck and chance led to a reunion between Jay Kinder and Michael Reese one summer afternoon at Lake Texoma in Oklahoma. Real estate was the discussion of the day as a young Jay Kinder shared how he sold 233 homes the previous year to a receptive Michael Reese. Who knew that this chance encounter would turn into the wildly successful partnership that is now Kinder Reese Real Estate Advisors? 

Since that day, Michael, Jay, and their teams have sold more than 4,250 homes. Together, they have brought in more than $18,000,000 in commissions for their real estate businesses. 

Both Jay and Michael have been members of Realtor Magazine’s prestigious “30 under 30” group. They have both been ranked in the Top 100 of the 400 most successful real estate teams in North America by The Wall Street Journal’s “Real Trends.” 

Individually, Jay has established himself as one of the top agents in the world, selling more than 3,000 homes and capturing 14% market share in Lawton, Oklahoma. In 2007, Jay was named #2 in the world for Coldwell Banker, competing with over 120,000 realtors –the youngest to ever achieve this. The results don’t stop there; in 2007, Jay was ranked #1 in Oklahoma and #2 in the Southern Region, which includes over 1,700 realtors from 14 states. He was recognized as the #1 Sales Associate in Oklahoma between 2002 and 2010 before opening his new company, Jay Kinder Real Estate Experts in 2011. 

 Michael has also enjoyed immense success as one of Keller Williams’ top 50 agents worldwide. His company, Michael Reese & Associates, is regularly ranked as one of the Top 5 teams in the Southwest Region for Keller Williams. He and his team recently broke the record for buyer sales for the Keller Williams branch he worked out of in Frisco, Texas – before going independent as the Michael Reese Home Selling Team. Michael earned $1,000,000 in GCI after only his third year in the business and he hasn’t made less since. 

CelebrityPress™ describes the book: 

In this increasingly complex financial world, we try to make the most efficient use of our disposable income. In our western economy, we typically try to purchase assets as frugally as possible and sell them subsequently for as much as we can in the open market. Generally speaking, we try to obtain TOP DOLLAR for each item we sell. In the buying and selling of real estate, our homes rank up there as one of the most important transactions we will ever make financially and emotionally. Some of us may even purchase and sell several residences over the course of our lifetime. In addition, many people buy and sell houses as commodities, making them into income-producing investments and businesses. 

While some people manage their transactions on their own, most of us are ill-equipped to do so. It is for this reason that this book was written. The guidance of the CelebrityExperts® in this book will likely be eye-opening for those who may wish to sell or purchase real estate - and avoid any errors these experts encountered and discussed. It is for this reason we would not normally ask a doctor to represent us in a court of law, nor an attorney to perform surgery on us. 

The CelebrityExperts® who have written this book discuss their areas of expertise and mentor you on them. They have both the experience and certifications to back up their presentations. In this day and age, it is only prudent to use the expertise of an experienced professional - one who can guide you through the maze of real estate transactions - in order to obtain the TOP DOLLAR for your property. 

After such a successful release, Michael and Jay will be recognized by The National Academy of Best-Selling Authors™, an organization that honors authors from many of the leading independent best-seller lists.

A portion of the royalties earned from Top Dollar will be given to the Entrepreneur’s International Foundation, a not for profit organization dedicated to creating unique launch campaigns to raise money and awareness for charitable causes.

	    	page     (September 14, 2015) 
 Washington, DC (PRWEB)  September 14, 2015  

Enormous crowds are expected to gather along the National Mall to get a glimpse of Pope Francis when he addresses a joint session of Congress this Thursday, Sept. 24. 
 
And as they have for the past three Presidential Inaugurations, the team from Argyle, Texas-based GoVision has been enlisted to provide the giant LED screens needed to give the assembled masses the best possible view. 

GoVision is providing five massive screens for the historic occasion. A 19 x 33 G16 unit and a 17 x 27 G12 unit will flank the U.S. Capitol lawn to give the general public a real-time view of the Popes address. In addition, three 9 x 16 LED walls comprised of GV6mm ultra-lightweight panels will be positioned on the steps of the Capitol for invited dignitaries and other VIP attendees. 

 
One-day events just dont get any bigger than this, so we couldnt be more honored to have been tasked with this incredibly important responsibility, said Chris Curtis, CEO and founder of GoVision L.P. We know what an enormous undertaking it is to broadcast live video from the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, especially with the entire world watching. But our team is up to the challenge, and were ready to be a part of history. 
 
The Popes visit to Washington will serve as a fitting showcase for some of the most state-of-the-art LED equipment on the market. GoVisions new GV6 panels, which weigh in at just 40 pounds per tile, offer extremely high resolution both indoors and out. In addition to its ultra lightweight, the GV6 product is a solid/black face LED technology, which eliminates the transparency issues often found in other panels. The tiles can be viewed clearly from as close as three feet, without loss of clarity.

A190,"Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson celebrated his birthday Friday by poking fun at front-runner Donald Trump. 
 
""I guess the best birthday present is I heard Donald Trump had dropped out,"" he joked Friday at Heritage Action for America's presidential forum in Greenville, South Carolina. 
 
""Oh, wait a minute. That was just for today,"" Carson said. 
 
Trump at the last minute canceled his appearance at the conservative forum, citing the need to close ""a significant business transaction"" that was delayed. 
    
Trump's cancellation came after he took fire for refusing Thursday to address an attendee's assertion that Muslims are a ""problem"" in America and that President Barack Obama is a Muslim during a campaign event in New Hampshire. 
 
Trump's campaign manager told CNN that Trump did not hear the questioner make those statements and only heard the questioner ask about Muslim terrorist training camps in the U.S.

A191,"MISSION, KS -- (Marketwired) -- 09/17/15 --  (Family Features) The dangers of distracted driving affect thousands of lives each year. Are you taking the proper steps to ensure a safe driving experience for you, your passengers and others on the road? 

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the numbers are all too real, with 3,154 people killed in 2013 due to distracted driving on the road. While many states have adopted laws to crack down on phone usage behind the wheel, real change starts at home, with drivers pledging to adopt simple safety measures and ensuring family members also make the commitment. 
     
As advocates for safe driving everywhere, the car experts at Edmunds.com offer these tips for safe travels behind the wheel: 

Limit the distractions. While it's always a good idea to have a phone with you in case of a breakdown or other auto emergency, keep distractions out of sight while driving. Turn your phone on silent, ""airplane mode"" or off completely before you enter your vehicle. Placing your phone in the glove box, the back seat or the trunk -- or even just in a bag -- can also keep the temptation of answering your calls or texts at bay, so you can focus on the road instead. 

Just drive. Many other activities can also be distracting in the car, such as eating, drinking, managing your entertainment or even putting on makeup. Make sure your car is used only for getting you from point A to point B, and save the other activities for your destination. 

Make it a family priority. Discuss the responsibilities that come with driving a vehicle and the hazards that accompany distracted driving. Set rules for your whole family so teen drivers know that you too are engaged in creating a safe zone in your own vehicle. Be a good role model even before your children are old enough to drive so they witness only good habits. 

Set a reminder for safety. Place a sticky note on your phone or a photo of a loved one in a non-obstructive location in your car to remind you of your commitment to safe driving. Tech savvy owners of the Apple Watch can download the DrivePromise app created by Edmunds.com, which is free and allows users to upload a photo of a loved one. The app will then detect if the wearer is in a moving vehicle, bringing up the photo as a psychological reminder to drive safely. 

Don't be a passive passenger. Spreading the message about safe driving doesn't stop when you're in the passenger seat. If you're in the car with an individual using their phone, ask them to put it down for their safety and for yours. 

Become an advocate for safe driving, and tell your family, friends, neighbors and everyone you know about the dangers of distracted driving. Safer roads start with smart, focused driving. For more information on staying safe on the road, visit http://www.edmunds.com/car-safety/ .

MUNTINLUPA, PHILIPPINES (Catholic Online) - It was announced that drones of all sized and selfie sticks were added to the list of banned items when attending Papal-related events. 
According to NDTV, firearms and plastic toy guns are still not allowed, nor can you bring large-scale religious statues or any toys that mimics weapons.  


""If you plan to attend any of the papal visit events, please leave your drone at home. Anyone flying a drone within the designated restricted areas may be subject to civil and criminal charges,"" said Michael Huerta, administrator at the Federal Aviation Administration.  
Washington, New York and Philadelphia are to host papal events and have all declared ""No Drone Zones"" by the administration. Even remote-controlled model planes are not allowed in the vicinity of these areas. There have yet to be drafted regulations regarding small drones, however there is a budding history of issues concerning personal privacy. 
Selfie sticks will not be allowed to any events as security heightens, despite its popularity among smartphone users and its use in wide-scale celebrations. Laser pointers and glass bottles are also part of the no-no list during papal gatherings.  
Regulations, according to the report, advised people not to bring any animals with them during events unless they are certified assistant animals. Large religious statues and signs are also to stay at home. 
Meanwhile, 6 activists with the Global Catholic Climate Movement started a 10-day fast in support of Pope Francis' campaign on climate change and the environment. They said they are raising awareness, saying their position in the issue is a tough one. 
Patrick Carolan, executive director of the Franciscan Action Network said, ""We need to make changes in our lifestyles ... Just stop being such consumers. We have to really live simply, stop using so much fossil fuels, (moving) toward renewable energy, eat less meat.""

A193,"Tatton Sykes Monument 
 
Terry Fletcher 
   
Terry Fletcher avoids touristy knick-knackery and enjoys the olde worlde charms of the Wolds around Wetwang 
  
The Yorkshire Wolds sometimes feel like a time capsule, a remnant of a quieter, more peaceful England before the coming of motorways and mass tourism. Aloof from the hustle and bustle, it is an often deserted landscape interspersed with picturesque villages that have grown around village ponds and sky-tickling steeples. It changes slowly with the seasons: in spring the green is splashed with day-glo yellow fields of oil seed rape, in high summer it turns golden with ripening wheat and barley and in winter it becomes the palest of brown corduroy as vast fields of chalky soil go under the plough in neat furrows. 

Because it is not a national park nor designated in any way, the byways tend to be empty and the villages have been spared the tweeness and knick-knackery that afflict so many of the visitor honeypots of the Moors and Dales. No telly-inspired Heartbeat Country or Herriot trails here. 

DIRECTIONS 

1. This ramble sets off from the peaceful if quaintly-named village of Wetwang and traverses field paths and an old drovers’ road to visit a spectacular monument. It offers no drama or adrenaline, just a few hours passed amid a rolling arable landscape that might have been created especially to soothe the soul. 

2. By the duck pond turn down the side of the village pub towards Sledmere. After 100 yards take a signed public footpath leading between cottages on the right. It leads through a play area and out through a gap in the hedge opposite. Turn left down the side of field and follow its boundary along the bottom to reach a sunken track. Turn left down this heading towards Station Farm. Turn right in front of this and follow the lane onwards aiming for the slender needle of the Sykes Monument on the skyline. 

3. When the lane reaches Grange Farm do not enter the farmyard but instead followed the arrowed path around to the left. Ignore a signed bridleway half way round but continue following the yellow arrows around the farm to continue your original line traversing the foot of two fields to reach a chalk-surfaced farm track and turn left up it. Follow it briefly towards a line of trees and where the track turns right carry straight on to the trees and pass through the narrow woodland and press on directly ahead to the next line of trees. 

4. The path climbs to a pair of gates and immediately beyond joins a deeply-rutted green lane. The return route turns left here but it would be a shame not to visit the monument so first head rightwards to visit the tower.It is 120ft high and was built in memory of Sir Tatton Sykes the fourth Baronet, who was by all accounts, a liberal landlord by the standards of his day and a much-loved countryman, known as “t’Aud Squire”. He married at the age of 50, fathered eight children and lived to be 90. The monument, which resembles an earthbound rocket of Whitby and Mansfield stone, was built in 1865 and has been a prominent Wolds landmark ever since and a jewel of the Sledmere estate, which has been owned by the Sykes family for 250 years. 

5. From the monument, head back along the green lane, an old drivers’ road, which is followed unerringly as it traverses the side of the shallow valley with extensive views. After a couple of miles (3km) it reaches a road. If time is pressing this would provide a short cut back to Wetwang. However cross over and carry on along the green lane for another mile of so (2km) to a second road. 

6. Again, cross over still following the green lane. The right of way continues for another 100 yards or so to where a footpath sign on the left points diagonally back through crops to the road you have just crossed. Wear and tear on the ground, however, suggests that most people, having crossed the road, simply turn left up the inside of the hedge beside the road, an arrangement which would avoid trampling crops and may suit both walkers and farmer alike. 

7. Both routes lead to a signed gap in the hedge where the right of way crosses the road to where another signpost directs walkers diagonally across the field towards Wetwang. A stile points the way across and into a large field which is crossed diagonally to a gate by farm buildings almost in the far right hand corner. Another gate leads out onto a side road. Go down this with houses to one side and fields on the other to the T-junction. Turn right to get back to the village pond.

A194,"A COUPLE who set up an aid organisation to help the migrant crisis have been ‘overwhelmed’ by Thurrock’s amazing response. 
 
Side-by-Side was started on Facebook by Rachel Hattingh and her husband Graham Marshall, a London homeless charity chief executive, from Stanford-le- Hope. 
 
It all started out with a message on Facebook a few weeks ago, now donations on their Just Giving page have ballooned to almost £9,000. 
 
Rachel Hattingh, a teacher at Thameside Primary School, told how donations shot up from £200 to £7,000 in just 24 hours. 
 
Rachel Hattingh said: “I have had so many people calling and asking to help.” 
 
Both Rachel and fellow organiser Kerry-Ann Branco will next week be travelling out to Calais with supplies, including tents, sleeping bags and food. The volunteers are working with French organisations on the front line to help identify those most in need. 
 
A small group of volunteers have been overseeing the ‘small mountain’ of donated items, which were also helped by coordinated efforts from T r a n s f o r m a t i o n Thurrock and local churches. 
 
Rachel said: “It started off with me and my husband seeing on the news just how people suffering in Calais and thinking, goodness me, if I was in that situation I would want to think people were doing something to help. 
 
“I know that in Essex sometimes there are some strong views, but the response has been overwhelming. 
 
“Hundreds of people from all works of life have been giving us items, from children to grandparents.

“It has been more than a decade and while he and everyone else have moved on, I am still standing here—alone, waiting.” 

This month, fourteen years ago. 

It was when he and I officially ended. It will take me a year and many more months before I can stop denying that truth to myself. But it was over then, nonetheless. Unlike the many breakups we had, that very last time, he didn’t go after me, didn’t ask me back, didn’t try to win me over. 

That heartbreak led me to leave our hometown, my family, my comfort zone, and everything and everyone I knew and grew up with and start somewhere anew. It was difficult, scary and painful. Many times did I want to just pack my bags and go back home but didn’t. 

I still wonder how I could have stayed away for so long. But I was determined to do it not only because I needed to save face, but also because I knew I couldn’t be in the same vicinity and not pine for him. 

Only God knows how many times I have driven by his house or plans I orchestrated to make sure I’d bump into or get a glimpse of him, or even how I slept with the phone right beside me to make sure I won’t ever miss a ring, a beep, a call, hoping it is him. 

Later I learned there was someone else. Unlike what he told me, the girl my friends had been seeing him with was not his sister. She was the girl he was about to marry two years later, have kids and build a happy home with. 

Many years after that day in July that sealed our fate, I managed to live my life far away and went on to have a great career, relationships, even marriage—in spite of the “closure” talk I felt I needed and never got. He too got promoted and became his company’s big boss. I moved on because I needed it to function. He moved on too—and in a big way. 

His wife’s work eventually made him move overseas, while circumstances led me back home after a decade. As I write this, I’m at the airport waiting for my flight and thinking about him and me and the nonexistent us. 

I heard he was flying in with his wife and kids to our hometown for a vacation. By sheer coincidence, I was flying out the same day, today, for work and vacation too. It had been days since I knew and I couldn’t keep still since. I have been preoccupied with thoughts of his return—at work, while driving, when I wake up, and before I retire at night. Like my crying bouts 14 years ago, this happens anywhere and everywhere. 

Funny how fate works, him flying in the same day I am flying out. I wonder if it is the universe setting us up to coincidentally bump into each other or conspiring to keep us apart—like it has done in the past 14 years. 

God knows I don’t know what I’ll do when I see him. With him, I don’t trust myself enough to do what is right. 

It has been more than a decade and while he and everyone else have moved on, I am still standing here. Alone. Waiting, still waiting, for I don’t know what. A closure talk, perhaps? A proper ending to our love story? 

Believe me, I’m a sensible girl. If a friend is in a same predicament as I am and has asked for my advice, I will say, leave, let it be. Don’t wait for a closure that may never happen and just believe that things end for a reason. 

But like a doctor who can’t heal his own wounds, I can’t too. I’m messed up, like I was 14 years ago. Better now, maybe, but still messed up. 

No matter how impossible it may seem, I still pray for that day to come—that he’ll help me close this chapter of my life, the way he has done with his. At the very least, please, please, let me have that. 

Elle Miller, 33, is back at her hometown down south and dabbles in a career as a wordsmith.

A196,"Author: Chung-In Moon, Yonsei University 
 
On the brink of a crisis that threatened to escalate into conflict, North and South Korea recently reached an agreement on 25 August to prevent further confrontation, resume official talks, hold reunions of separated families and promote civilian exchanges. This was a remarkable reversal in tensions. But the thaw is only the beginning of a precarious and long journey toward peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. As long as Pyongyang keeps its nuclear weapons program, it is virtually inconceivable that confidence-building and peaceful co-existence between the two Koreas can be achieved. 
 

 
Since March 2009, the North Korean nuclear issue has been stalled and the Six-Party Talks suspended. While North Korea has declared ‘no more talks with the US’, Washington is equally reluctant to engage with Pyongyang unless the hermit regime takes some concrete steps toward denuclearisation. Stuck between the two, China, South Korea and other the other Six-Party Talks members have become lethargic. Are there any ways out? 
 
The recent Iranian nuclear deal could serve as a useful benchmark. As President Barack Obama claims, it was a victory of diplomacy over war. Several factors account for its success. Setting realistic goals was one of those factors. Against the conservative’s all-or-nothing approach of insisting on ‘no deal without a complete removal of nuclear programs’, the US admitted Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, while banning its enrichment programs under a tight inspection regime. 
 
Equally crucial was setting the right priorities. Iran has been notorious for its sponsorship of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, interference in the domestic politics of neighbouring countries, undermining regional stability and human rights violations. But the nuclear issue was prioritised, with the anticipation that other issues would become easier to solve once the nuclear one was settled. The US also aptly limited sanctions, which was useful in bringing Iran to the negotiation table and making the current deal. Additional sanctions would have created a serious political backlash, which could have penalised moderates such as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while empowering such hardliners as radical Islamic forces and the military. 
 
Iran and North Korea are, of course, very different. Iran does not have nuclear weapons, while North Korea does. The permanent members of UN Security Council have all reached a consensus on the Iranian deal, but members of the Six-Party Talks have been divided over how to deal with the DPRK. Iran has taken a practical path to denuclearisation for economic gains, whereas North Korea is seeking the perilous nuclear path despite enormous economic costs incurred by sanctions. No matter how limited it may be, Iran has a pluralistic political system with regular competitive elections. North Korea, on the other hand, is an extremely monolithic political system without any free elections. 
 
For all the differences, the Iranian model can still be applied to North Korea. Sanctions, pressure and military action are not viable alternatives . The US should forsake its ‘strategic patience’ policy and engage. Demonising North Korea will lead the US nowhere. As with Iran, the US should set more practical goals. Complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear weapons will take a long time. As Siegfried Hecker — a renowned US nuclear expert — has suggested, it would be wiser to seek a ‘halt and roll back’ option. Freezing current nuclear programs and rolling back to the level specified by the agreement reached on 13 February 2007 — whereby North Korea agreed to shut down and seal its major nuclear research facility, Yongbyon, and invite international monitoring — might be the most practical solution. 
 
No matter how powerful the US is, it cannot achieve complete denuclearisation, opening and reform, human rights improvements and cyber security in North Korea simultaneously. There must be a reordering of priorities where utmost attention is given to the nuclear issue. The Iranian nuclear deal would have never materialised without personal commitments by top US Department of State officials like John Kerry, William Burns, Wendy Sherman and President Obama himself. In a similar vein, high powered figures need to be appointed solely to deal with Pyongyang. 
 
It is not easy for Obama to change his position on North Korea, particularly given his political schedule. Outside pressure seems necessary. Such pressure can come from South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who will be visiting Washington in October 2015. Using recent improved inter-Korean relations as leverage, Park can persuade Obama to engage with the North and to resume the Six-Party Talks. Such an approach is the only realistic one that can bring North Korea back to the negotiating table and foster the process of its denuclearisation . 
 
It is ironic to note that learning from its failures in dealing with North Korea was vital to the United States’ success in dealing with Iran. Now it is time for the Obama administration to apply what it has learned from Iran to North Korea.

A197,"By Wednesday, September 2nd, 2015 
    
By Mohammed Fahad Al-Harthi 
 
The first official visit of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman to Washington beginning on Thursday comes at a crucial time in the history of Saudi-US relations. 
 
Much anticipation surrounds the visit which will see a number of sensitive issues being brought to the table. It is no secret that Saudi-US differences have affected the region. The American mistake in Iraq and Washington’s pointless and naive withdrawal pushing the country into the Iranian swamp is one example. 
 
Other issues such as the Saudi-US disagreement regarding the June 30, 2013, events in Egypt, the shameful retraction of President Obama’s red line on the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the settlement afterward have also led to the two countries drifting apart. The situation has been worsened by the Iranian nuclear agreement that poses more questions than answers. 
 
Probably the most important question is whether our problem with Iran is limited to the nuclear deal. Many feel that the problem has its roots in Iran’s political policies in the region. Tehran seems to insist on intervening in internal Arab affairs and inciting sectarianism in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Yemen. 
 
While Riyadh and other Gulf capitals voice reservations, Washington is busy working for the agreement. Internally, the deal must be approved by Congress and externally, the Americans must keep other countries convinced of the deal’s importance. The Gulf states have made their position and desires clear: A region free of nuclear weapon and free of political conflicts, wars and militias — all of which are linked to Iran. 
 
Saudis recognize the strategic value and importance of the bilateral relations between Riyadh and Washington. As relations have stretched over a long history of ups and downs, the foundation and shared interests of the two countries have met all challenges. This has been particularly true when, on numerous occasions, Saudi-US relations have served as the region’s safety valve. 
 
Saudis stress the importance of the strategic relationship for both countries, acknowledging that disagreements arise from time to time. Washington has sought Saudi wisdom and experience many times since it knows that the Kingdom is a country with balanced and credible political thought which rejects extremism. This translates into both countries needing each other. 
 
The claims that the declining US interest in Saudi oil negatively affects the alliance are short-sighted. Saudi Arabia is not a barrel of oil but an influential country, a great economic power and member of the G-20. Shared interests thus override the points of dispute. 
 
King Salman, a veteran decision-maker and the experienced consultant of previous Saudi rulers, understands the importance of bilateral relations. Just as we saw in Operation Decisive Storm, he can be firm and take the initiative, knowing that Arabs can protect their interests in the region and will not acquiesce in the face of expansionist powers. 
 
In diplomatic relations between countries, respect is for the powerful. And power means not only military force but also the ability to influence and build political alliances. In this context, the Gulf system remains one of the most influential forces in the region, led by the highest-level coordination between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
 
The two countries filled the vacuum in the Arab political system and, with their alliance with Egypt, can save the region and prevent chaos. Once they share a political position, they have an influence on major powers. 
 
Washington knows that Saudi Arabia has launched a war on terror and the Saudi security forces’ success confirm Riyadh’s role. Only a few days ago, it arrested Ahmad Al-Mughassil, the mastermind behind the 1996 Alkhobar attacks. 
 
The Kingdom also provided important information to the US that foiled a possible suicide attack in a plane flying over Detroit in 2009. It also uncovered the presence of a bomb hidden in an ink container on a plane bound for Chicago in October 2010. Apart from intelligence and security cooperation, the US knows that Saudi Arabia has paid the price for its own safety and security in its fight against terror. 
 
The interlinked interests of the two countries make it difficult to put Saudi-US relations at risk. Economically, American companies have enormous investments in the Kingdom while Riyadh has huge deposits and investments in the US. Many senior Saudi officials graduated from American universities and there are currently 120,000 Saudi students studying in the US.

A199,"Ariana Grande thinks that homophobia is ""dumb as f*ck."" The singer addressed homophobia during her recent interview with V magazine where she said, ""I mean, here’s the thing: I wasn’t raised in a household where it was considered abnormal to be gay. So for me to meet people who use the word 'f*ggot' as an insult, with a derogatory meaning, I can’t take it. I don’t understand it. It’s so foreign to me."" 

She continued, ""I was raised in a household where being gay was like, the most normal thing. You know, my brother is gay, all of my best friends are gay. When my brother came out of the closet, it wasn’t a big deal for my family. Even my grandpa, who is like, super old-school, was like, ‘Good for you!’ It’s outrageous to me when I see people hate on someone because of their sexuality. I hate the intolerance. I hate the judgment. I hate it so much. Most of my favorite people in my life are gay. It’s something I’m super passionate about, because whenever I would see my friends get bullied, or my brother get hurt for his sexuality, I would become a raging lunatic. I would literally become a raging lunatic because I just can’t take it."" 

Ariana added, ""When you see someone you love hurting, for such a superficial, bullsh*t reason, it’s like, how small and spiritually unenlightened and dumb as f*ck can a person be? How much further can your head get up your a** that you’re actually judging someone as a person based on their sexuality before you even have a conversation with them?"" 

KANYE WEST IS DEFINITELY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 

Fri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST 

So . . . Kanye West is definitely running for president. The rapper told Vanity Fair about his plans, ""When I run for president, I’d prefer not to run against someone. I would be like ‘I want to work with you.’ As soon as I heard Ben Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him. I was like this is the most brilliant guy. And I think all the people running right now have something that each of the other’s needs. But the idea of this separation and this gladiator battle takes away from the main focus that the world needs help and the world needs all the people in a position of power or influence to come together…"" 

He added, ""I hate politics. I’m not a politician at all. I care about the truth and I just care about human beings."" 

He also spoke on the release of his upcoming album SWISH, saying, ""I’m not sure. I’m not worried about the years. I’m worried about the life and the body of work that I can put out while I’m breathing."" Fri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST 

Selena Gomez has opened up about how her growth has affected the process of her upcoming album, Revival. During an interview with the New York Times, the singer explained, ""I was in a relationship, and I was being managed by my parents, and I was still under Hollywood and Disney, and I was being held to this expectation of being the good girl."" 

Selena even spoke of ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber, referencing their parallel success, saying, ""While people were writing that I was stupid for being in it, this is what I always saw in him. I’m like, duh!"" 

On her friendship with Taylor Swift, Selena said, ""Taylor is a lot more trusting than I am. I have trust issues, given my situation. She’s very open, so she brings out this other side of me. 

Meanwhile, Taylor told the NY Times, ""In the last two years, I’ve seen Selena start to make her career her own. She’s separated her opinion out and prioritized it above anyone else’s. Her childhood was defined by working hard, with the major business decisions primarily being made by others. The coolest part of watching her grow up has been seeing her gradually take the creative reins and start to steer the ship.""

Fri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST 

Taylor Swift is the highest-ranked entertainer on Forbes' ""40 under 40"" list. The mag released the list on Thursday (September 24th), where the top 40 ""most influential young people in business"" are ranked. However, this list was ""100 percent brand new,"" which meant that in order to be ranked, you could not have been featured on previous ""40 under 40"" lists. 

Taylor placed number six on the list, with Forbes saying, ""The country crooner turned pop mega-star was the single highest-earning musician last year, but that’s not what earned her the respect and attention of the business world. It was her surprising and effective public stance against free music."" 

Other celebs to make the list include John Oliver, Jessica Alba and Ronda Rousey. 

Adam Neumann -- the 36-year-old founder and CEO of WeWork received the top spot on the list.

JAY Z DOESN'T WANT HIS $150 MILLION LIVE NATION DEAL MENTIONED IN 'BIG PIMPIN'' CASE 

Fri, 25 Sep 2015 01:00:00 EST 

Sandra Rose has reported that Jay Z returned to court to plead with the judge over his ""Big Pimpin'"" lawsuit to keep the deets of his $150 million Live Nation deal under wraps. According to the site, Jay claims that disclosing the terms of his new deal could interfere with future negotiations with other companies. 

The rapper recently filed docs in the case, demanding that his past run-ins with the law not be allowed to be discussed in the courtroom. Jay says that the man suing him -- whose name is Osama Ahmed Fahmy, mentioned bringing up his criminal past during the trial. Jay also said that mentioning his run-ins with the law is ""absurd"" because he hasn't had a criminal conviction in the past 10 years, nor does the current case have anything to do with his criminal past. 

The rapper also requested that his net worth not be allowed to be mentioned in court, claiming that the only reason to inform the jury of his finances is to make them biased and give the plaintiff a larger amount of money in damages. 

Jay pleaded with the judge regarding his Live Nation deal earlier this week, saying that the agreement contains sensitive financial information regarding his business relationship with the company. The 80-page agreement shows the calculations of Jay's earnings for each concert. 

Jay also says that Live Nation upholds strict confidentiality of their artist agreements and that minimal employees have access to those documents.
